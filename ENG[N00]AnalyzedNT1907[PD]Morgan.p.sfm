MATTHEW 

MATTHEW was a Hebrew, whose calling 
in life was that of a tax-gatherer under 
the Roman government. His writing evi- 
dences his acquaintance with the Hebrew 
Scriptures, and especially with those which 
foretold the coming of the Messiah King. 
Thus, both in his religious thinking and in 
the prosecution of his daily calling he was 
familiar with the idea of government. 

His story of the life and work of Jesus is 
naturally therefore a setting forth of the King 
and His Kingdom. The book falls into three 
parts. In the first Matthew introduces the 
Person (i.-iv. 16) ; in the second he tells the 
story of the Propaganda (iv. 17-xvi. 20) ; and 
in the last chronicles the events of the Passion 
(xvi. 21-xxviii.). 

A. The Person of the King 

The King is presented to us in a threefold 
relation: to earth, to heaven, and to hell. 

As to the first, after the manner of His 
nation, the genealogy which sets Him in 



12 Matthew 



purely Jewish legal relationship is given. 
Then follows the account of His birth, and it 
is the only account of the origin of the unique 
Personality of Jesus which is at all able to 
satisfy the reason. In a mystery passing our 
comprehension, the King is Son of God, and 
Son of Mary. Chronologically there is a great 
gap between the birth and the baptism, which 
is filled by the years of human growth and 
development at Nazareth. As the days ap- 
proached for the commencement of His prop- 
aganda, His herald, the last of the long line 
of Hebrew prophets, appeared to the nation; 
and with a baptism of water, and words of 
authoritative rebuke and hope, he announced 
the advent of the King. 

Crowning the ministry of the herald, the 
King appeared, and was baptized in Jordan. 
In connection with that baptism His relation 
to heaven was manifest. There w^as first the 
coming upon Him of the Spirit. This was the 
sacred ceremony by which He was set apart 
to the exercise of the Kingly office. Simulta- 
neously with the anointing, the silence of the 
heaven was broken, and the words of the 
Father attested Him King. The second psalm 
should carefully be read in this connection. 
The declaration, "I am well pleased," attested 
the perfection of the life which had been lived 



Jesus Christ the King 13 

in seclusion, especially in the light of the fact 
that by baptism the King's submission to the 
Divine will for all the purposes of redemption 
was symbolized. 

Immediately from the lofty experiences of 
anointing and attestation the King passed to 
the lonely conflict of the wilderness. Here He 
came into grips with the arch-enemy of the 
race, the conspirator against heaven's order. 
The devil attacked Him in the threefold fact 
of His human personality, the material basis, 
the spiritual essence, and the vocational pur- 
pose. In every case victory was on the side 
of the King, and that by simple submission to 
the law of God. Thus His royalty was created 
and demonstrated by His loyalty. 

Behold, this is our King! Sharer of our 
nature, and yet bringing into it the Divine 
nature. Appointed to rule by God Himself, 
and equipped for adminstration by the pleni- 
tude of the Spirit. Meeting every onslaught 
of the foe, and triumphing! Surely we may 
trust Him. The only adequate expression of 
trust is obedience. 

B. The Propaganda of the King 

The next division contains the account of 
the propaganda of the King, in which there 
are three movements : the enunciation of laws. 



14 Matthew 



the exhibition of benefits, and the enforcement 
of claims. 

He first gathered around Him a nucleus of 
disciples. Some of these had been called in 
the earlier Judaean ministry, which Matthew 
does not record. They were now called to 
abandon their fishing in order to be with Him. 

After a period of teaching in the synagogues 
of Galilee, He gathered these disciples, and 
gave to them His manifesto, in which He first 
insisted upon the supreme importance of char- 
acter in His Kingdom; and declared its pur- 
pose to be that of producing influence, which 
He illustrated under the figures of salt and 
light. He then enunciated His laws, prefac- 
ing them with a prelude on the importance of 
law. His laws fall into three groups: first, 
those of human inter-relationship, which He 
illustrated by two quotations from the deca- 
logue, dealing with murder and adultery ; and 
two from the wider law of Moses, dealing with 
truth and justice, adding a new law of love, 
even toward enemies. Next came the laws of 
Divine relation, which declared the principle 
that life was to be lived before God rather 
than before men, and then was illustrated by 
application to alms, to prayer, to fasting. 
Finally He revealed the necessity for a super- 
earthly consciousness, as He warned them 



Jesus Christ the King 15 

against covetousness and against care. Pass- 
ing to the great subject of the dynamic, in the 
power of which it would be possible for His 
subjects to obey His ethic, He first warned 
them against censoriousness, and enjoined dis- 
crimination; then declared to them that in 
answer to their asking, seeking, knocking, 
they would receive, find, and the door would 
be opened, because they had to do with a 
Father. The last words of the manifesto 
were of the nature of invitation, warning, and 
the uttering of the Kingly claim. The effect 
produced upon the multitude who had listened 
to the manifesto uttered to the disciples was 
that of astonishment at His authority. 

While the King had described His Kingdom 
to the faithful few in the hearing of the multi- 
tude, His will was that it should include all 
men within its embrace. His mission was not 
to compel by force of arms, but to constrain 
to willing submission to Himself. In order 
to do this He went forth, working to illustrate 
the benefits which must come to such as lived 
within His Kingdom. This working of won- 
ders was no merely spectacular display on the 
part of Christ. It was a setting forth of the 
fact that He was King in all the realms by 
which their lives were affected. There are 
three distinct movements noticeable, each cul- 



16 Matthew 



minating in an effect produced upon the 
crowds. 

In the first He demonstrated His power in 
the purely physical realm by healing leprosy, 
palsy, and fever, and with an astonishing ease, 
all that were sick. Thus the King of right- 
eousness in ethical ideals, proved Himself able 
to correct all disability in the physical realm 
resulting from sin. The result of this first 
manifestation of His power was a spontaneous 
and apparently enthusiastic determination to 
follow Him on the part of some. Following, 
however, is not easy. He immediately pre- 
sented the difficulties of the way, and yet in- 
sisted on the absolute importance of coming 
after Him by calling men to break with every 
other tie rather than fail in this matter. 

In the second movement the King's power 
was seen operating in other spheres. He was 
Master of the elements. He exercised imperial 
SAvay in the mystic spirit-world. He claimed 
authority in the moral realm. The result pro- 
duced upon the multitude by these manifesta- 
tions was that they were afraid, and glorified 
God. 

The third manifestation included the first 
two in its exercise of power, in both physical 
and spiritual realms. He recalled the spirit 
of the child of Jairus to its clay tenement, and 



Jesus Christ the King 17 

by the healing of a woman, revealed His 
method of answering faith by the communica- 
tion of virtue. The result produced upon the 
multitudes now was that they were filled with 
wonder, and the Pharisees suggested an ex- 
planation, to which they gave more definite 
voice later. 

The section dealing with His enforcement 
of claims opens with a brief paragraph, full of 
suggestiveness, revealing the King's heart, as 
in the presence of all the need of men He is 
ever moved with compassion. He now called 
twelve of His disciples, and commissioned 
them as apostles. His charge to them included 
instructions which affected their immediate 
work, and indicated the lines of the work of 
their successors to the end of the age. This 
commissioning of the apostles was immedi- 
ately followed by four illustrations of the kind 
of obstacles which confronted the King in His 
work. The perplexity of the loyal was mani- 
fest in the question of John ; the unreasonable- 
ness of the age in His description of its chil- 
dren; the impenitence of the cities in His 
denunciation of them; and finally, the blind- 
ness of the simple. 

The King is then seen in conflict. Opposi- 
tion to Him became active. Twice the rulers 
attacked Him concerning His attitude to the 



18 Matthew 



Sabbath. They attempted to account for His 
power by attributing it to complicity with the 
devil. With supercilious unbelief, they asked 
a sign. Moreover, He had to contend with 
opposition which must have been more painful 
to Him than that of His avowed enemies. His 
own mother, unable to understand Him, 
sought to persuade Him to abandon His 
work. 

In the presence of this increasing opposi- 
tion the King uttered His great parables of 
the Kingdom. These may be divided into two 
groups : firb-t, those spoken to the multitudes ; 
secondly, those spoken to the disciples only. 
In the first there are four parables, revealing 
the method of the King, the method of the 
enemy, the worldly growth of the Kingdom, 
and the introduction of the corrupting influ- 
ence of leaven. In the second there are four 
parables, the first three viewing the Kingdom 
from the Divine standpoint, the last teaching 
the responsibility of those to whom the revela- 
tion was committed. 

Proceeding with His work the King en- 
countered increasing opposition from His 
own, from the false king Herod, from Phari- 
sees and scribes, and from Pharisees and Sad- 
ducees. In the intervals of this clearly 
marked growth of antagonism there were re- 



Jesus Christ the King 19 



markable manifestations of Kingly power, re- 
vealing to such as had eyes to see, how benefi- 
cent was His rule. 

At last a crisis was reached. At Csesarea 
Philippi He gathered His disciples about Him, 
and asked them in effect what was the result 
of the work He had been doing. Their an- 
swers were remarkable, but none of them, re- 
porting the opinions of the multitude, satisfied 
His heart, and He challenged them as to their 
opinion. Peter's confession opened the way 
for the King's entry upon His final work. He 
had fulfilled the first movement of His min- 
istry, that of revealing to at least a handful of 
souls the truth concerning His Person, and 
His relation to the Divine economy. Hence- 
forth there would be a new note in His teach- 
ing, a further revelation in His attitudes. 

c. The Passion of the King 

The King practically broke with the multi- 
tudes at Csesarea Philippi. Henceforward 
His principal work was directed to leading the 
little group of His own into deeper apprecia- 
tion of the meaning of His mission. The mul- 
titudes, however, perpetually broke in upon 
His teaching, and He always answered them 
in blessing. With regard to His own. His 
teaching now centred around the Cross. At 



20 Matthew 



once they became afraid, and a distance be- 
tween Him and them is observable. To three 
of their number He granted a marvellous reve- 
lation of His glory. Yet even there the cen- 
tral thought was that of the Cross. During 
the days that followed all the disciples' pre- 
conceived notions of royalty, of greatness, of 
the value of material things, were rudely 
shaken as He declared to them the way to the 
crown must be that of the Cross. Yet let it 
be carefully observed that He never mentioned 
the Cross without also announcing the fact of 
resurrection. 

As the end approached, the King went to 
Jerusalem. All Old Testament history, from 
Abraham, culminated in that hour. For long 
years the greatness of the Hebrew people as a 
nation had passed away. The Roman eagles 
were spread above the standards of their own 
national life. To them the long-expected King 
had come, enunciating the laws of the King- 
dom, exhibiting its benefits, enforcing its 
claims. They had rejected the laws, despised 
the benefits, refused to yield to the claims. 
At last the King quietly, majestically, author- 
itatively rejected them. With quiet precision 
He prepared to enter the city, and, having 
arrived, occupied the throne of judgment, 
uttering words of righteous discrimination. 



Jesus Christ the King 21 

dealing with all objections until they were 
silenced. Thereupon He pronounced the 
final woes, and uttered the inevitable sen- 
tence. 

Having officially rejected the nation, He 
again devoted special time to His disciples. 
His action in Jerusalem had strangely puzzled 
them. He had offended the rulers past the 
possibility of reconciliation, and with a dig- 
nity which must have appalled His own, had 
flung the whole ruling class away. They came 
to Him with an incoherent outbreak of ques- 
tioning: "When shall these things be? and 
what shall be the sign of Thy coming, and of 
the end of the age?" Whatever they meant by 
these questions, the King treated their inquiry 
as threefold : first, concerning "these things'^ ; 
secondly, concerning His coming; finally, con- 
cerning the "end of the age.'' The King Who 
had been rejected by His own, and Who in 
turn had rejected them in their national ca- 
pacity, manifested nothing of doubt, nothing 
of disappointment, nothing of discouragement. 
From the midst of apparent failure and dis- 
aster He quietly and calmly surveyed the 
ages, claiming for Himself the position of con- 
tinual supremacy. 

For US the Via Dolorosa is always bathed 
in the sunlight of the resurrection. It is a 



22 Matthew 



little difficult to observe those dark and awful 
days in which the earthly ministry of the King 
ended. The ultimate victory is always sound- 
ing its triumphant music in our ears. And 
yet we must walk this way with Him medita- 
tively, and in some senses experimentally, if 
we would share the travail that makes His 
Kingdom come. Therefore, as we read and 
ponder the tragic story, let us pray for such 
illumination of His sorrows by the Spirit as 
shall give us to have some fuller consciousness 
of the cost at which our royal Master won the 
glorious victory. In proportion as we are 
able to do this, our songs of triumph will be 
richer, fuller, when striking death to death, 
He comes forth, never again to know defeat, 
but to move with sure and unerring progress 
to the ultimate victories. 

A solemn awe takes possession of the spirit 
as the final movements in the progress of the 
King are considered. No more radiant light 
ever fell from human love upon the sorrowing 
Christ than that of Mary's appreciation of 
His sorrow as expressed in her act of worship, 
and no more terrible darkness ever came to 
Him from human selfishness than that of 
Judas' treachery. A sad and solemn gather- 
ing, yet thrilling with hope, and merging in 
music, was the passover feast. There the 



Jesus Christ the King 23 

types and shadows of the past had their fitting 
ending in the presence of th^ Antitype and the 
Substance. 

And now the King passed into the darkness. 
We cannot accompany Him. We may rever- 
ently stand upon its outer margin, and listen 
with bowed heads to the sob of the unutter- 
able deep, as in a death-grapple in the dark- 
ness, He took hold upon the spoiler of His 
people. In the garden the last shadows of 
temptation fell, and the final triumph of de- 
votion was won. Terrible beyond all human 
comprehension was that to which the King 
passed. Glorious beyond all finite explana- 
tion was the stern triumph of the will which 
yielded itself at cost to the accomplishment of 
the One and only Will. That vast sea of sor- 
row broke in angry and hissing waves upon 
the shore, and from that surf we gain some 
faint and far-off notion of the sea. Then 
solemnly we follow Him by reading again and 
again the aw^ful story of the mind of love, 
stronger than death. 

All sorts and conditions of men were gath- 
ered about the Cross, and though at the mo- 
ment they did not realize it, it was in their 
midst, the King's great throne, at once a 
throne of judgment and a throne of grace. 
From it they parted, some to the right, others 



24 Matthew 



to the left, according as they crowned or cru- 
cified. 

Man's last and worst was done. The King 
was dead. From the moment of His dying 
none but tender hands touched Him, and from 
the moment of His burial none but loving eyes 
saw Him. 

The night has passed, the day has dawned. 
A new glory is on the whole creation. It will 
be long years, as men count time, ere the 
groaning cease, and the sob is hushed, but the 
deepest pain is passed in His pain, and the 
wound of humanity is staunched at its centre. 
Strange new glories break in the dawning of 
the first day of the week. 

The King's followers, discouraged and scat- 
tered, were gathered together, while a new 
heroism possessed them. For one brief while 
He tarried, and at last, with a majesty of 
authority such as man had never known. He 
uttered His commission, and declared His 
abiding presence. 

Reverently, and with meaning such as mor- 
tals never knew, there pass our lips in His 
presence words often uttered, but never before 
with such confidence or courage, "Long live 
the King," and in answer we hear His words 
spoken, a little later, to a lonely man in an 
island of the sea, "I am alive for evermore."

MARK 

"|\yTARK was the personal friend of Peter, 
-^-^^ and throughout his gospel the in- 
fluence of this friendship is manifest. The 
outlook therefore is that of a man himself 
familiar with toil, as were all the fishers 
of the Galilean lake. In this gospel we find 
Jesus presented as the Servant. He goes 
forward in unremitting submission to the 
calls of service, but it is impossible in His 
presence to indulge the familiarity which 
breeds contempt, or to feel the pity which pro- 
ceeds from a sense of superiority. The only 
contempt we feel as we watch Him at His 
work is for ourselves, who so miserably fail 
in our devotion; the only pity possible is for 
our own patent and infinite inferiority; and 
this is as it should be. The kingly and sub- 
missive are two sides of one quality in the 
nature of God. Even He is most royal when 
He stoops to service. In setting forth the 
wonders of Jesus as the Servant of God Mark 
deals with His Sanctification (i. 1-13) ; Service 
(i. 14-viii. 30); Sacrifice (viii. 31-xvi.).

28 Mark 



A. Sanctification 

In this division there are brought before us 
the remarkable movements through which 
Jesus was set apart to service. The keynote 
of the first section, which describes the work 
of the herald, is contained in the words ^'John 
came.'' His coming was in fulfilment of 
prophecy, and his mission was prophetic. The 
keynote of the section introducing Jesus is 
contained in the words ^^ Jesus came.'' At the 
Jordan He entered upon a new phase of toil. 
Through all the years, in the commonplaces of 
life. He had been serving. Now, by baptism. 
He deliberately identified Himself with sin- 
ners, and so set His face toward the specific 
service which He had come to render. In con- 
nection with His baptism He was anointed, 
and His fitness was attested by the voice of the 
Father. He then immediately passed into the 
wilderness, where, as Servant, in perfect sub- 
mission. He met in conflict the one who had 
rebelled against submission, and overcame 
him. He then stood upon the threshold of 
His work, wholly surrendered, perfectly 
equipped, and already victorious. 



Jesus Christ the Servant 29 

B. Service 

The division setting forth the perfect serv- 
ice of Jesus falls into three sections, the first 
dealing with His first disciples, and first 
work ; the second with the appointment of the 
twelve, and an advance in toil ; the third with 
the commissioning of the twelve, and co-oper- 
ation in service. 

Coming into Galilee, He first called four 
men into association with Himself, choosing 
those already trained to some form of work 
to be associated with Him in His. At Caper- 
naum He entered the synagogue on the Sab- 
bath day, and amid its rest. He continued His 
toil. Under the influence of His teaching, a 
demon-possessed man interrupted, and became 
the mouth-piece of the evil spirit within him. 
The testimony was remarkable. He spoke of 
Jesus as "the Holy One of God," and in the 
uttering of the words confessed his own de- 
feat. From the synagogue God's Servant 
passed to the home, and healed a woman, who 
immediately became herself a servant, minis- 
tering to Him and others. Multitudes gath- 
ered to Him, and He healed them with per- 
fect ease. From the press of the crowds He 
escaped to the mountain for a period of com- 
munion with His Father. There the clamour 



30 Mark 

of eager disciples broke in upon Him, and He 
passed on, continuing His toil in other cities. 
Leprosy, palsy, and sin in quick succession 
presented themselves before Him, and He 
dealt Avith each powerfully and finally. Fol- 
lowing this series of works is a series of words 
in which He first vindicated His method with 
sinners : His presence at the feast of the pub- 
lican was that of the Physician ; He was there 
to heal. He then vindicated His disciples' 
joy; how eould they be sad while He was with 
them? Again He indicated His attitude to- 
ward the Sabbath by declaring that the Son of 
Man was Lord thereof. His anger in the syn- 
agogue with the lack of tenderness in the heart 
of His accusers revealed the keen sensitiveness 
of His own heart. Deep and pure emotion is 
alw^ays costly. The last paragraph in this 
section reveals His ceaseless activity; multi- 
tudes pressed upon Him with their woes and 
wounds and w^eaknesses; there was no limit 
to His power; He touched, and they were 
healed. 

The time had now arrived for calling others 
into fellowship with Himself. This He did, 
deliberately making His own choice upon the 
basis of unerring wisdom. Those chosen were 
appointed first to be with Him, and secondly 
to be sent forth. It was now that the opposi- 



Jesus Christ the Servant 31 

tion of His relatives was manifest. It was 
the opposition of affection so far as His 
mother was concerned. She felt that His toil 
without cessation was a symptom of madness. 
It must have caused Him acute suffering that 
neither His mother nor His relatives under- 
stood Him. Without break His toil proceeded. 
The rulers suggested that He was in league 
with the powers of evil. In denying the 
charge the Lord made use of some of the most 
solemn and awful words that ever fell from 
His lips. He did not say that these men had 
committed the unpardonable sin, but that they 
had approached the confines thereof in attrib- 
uting to Satan the works of God. To carry 
that suggestion out, and finally reject Him 
Who did the works is the unpardonable sin. 
After His warning to the rulers He revealed 
the positive facts concerning the Kingdom in 
the present age in a series of parables. Once 
we have a picture of Him resting, and it is 
pre-eminently suggestive that His rest was in 
the midst of a storm. Even here He was dis- 
turbed by His disciples, and readily responded 
in glad service on their behalf. Arrived upon 
the other shore. He was at once at work again. 
He healed the demoniac, and then, besought by 
the men of the city, passed back over the sea, 
and there, in answer to the sob of a father's 



32 Mark 

heart, accompanied him to the home into 
which death had come. On the way disease 
approached Him in the person of a woman, 
weak and trembling, yet confident; and she 
was answered with the virtue of His healing. 
He came to Nazareth, and there the blighting 
influence of self-centred prejudice was force- 
fully illustrated. The wonder of His words 
and works was patent to them, but because 
He was one of them, they were offended. 

Through all this section it must be remem- 
bered that the disciples were fulfilling the first 
part of their appointment. They were with 
Him. They had not yet been sent forth. Fol- 
lowing Him they beheld His method, and be- 
came imbued with some measure of His Spirit. 
By the way of this comradeship He was pre- 
paring them for immediate service, and com- 
mencing their preparation for the larger work 
which would devolve upon them in the days 
when He, as to bodily presence, was removed 
from them. 

The apostles having thus been with Him for 
a period, were commissioned and sent forth. 
They were to be the servants of the Servant, 
and consequently it was necessary that in 
every way they should represent Him. The 
attitude of service was emphasized by the pov- 
erty of their going: no bread, no wallet, no 



Jesus Christ the Servant 33 

money. There were three essential matters in 
their equipment. They were to go shod with 
sandals, they were to go two by two, they were 
to go in His name. Thus tenderly the Master 
provided for all necessities, and swept aside 
all superfluities. His instructions concerning 
the method of their work were simple yet 
drastic. In any city or village they were to 
accept the hospitality of one dwelling, and 
refuse to go to others. They were not to con- 
form to conventionalities w^hich would con- 
sume their time, and hinder their w^ork. They 
would not be everywhere received. This was 
no part of their responsibility. The story of 
the murder of John is told at this point in the 
narrative of Mark, in explanation of a fear 
which possessed the heart of Herod as he 
heard of the work of Jesus. The disciples re- 
turned to Jesus and reported everything. He 
invited them to a desert place for rest, which 
they never reached. Yet the short voyage 
over the sea with Christ must have been rest 
for them. His presence is home, His voice is 
music. His look is sunshine, His touch is life. 
Arrived on the other shore the multitude were 
waiting, and with perfect readiness the great 
Servant of God sacrificed His own rest and 
quietness that He might minister to their 
needs. Back again across the sea to escape 



34 Mark 

the crowd, and for Jesus a short respite on 
the mountain, while His disciples returned 
yet once more over the sea at His bidding. 
Their sorrow brought Him to them miracu- 
lously, and mightily; and the storm was 
stilled. Again He gave Himself in unstinted 
outpouring to the multitudes as He healed 
their sick. Then followed a discussion with 
the scribes and Pharisees in which He revealed 
the difference between tradition and com- 
mandment, the former being the law of cus- 
tom, and the latter the law of God. The final 
movements in the section reveal Him still at 
work, casting out demons, healing the deaf, 
feeding the multitude, and healing the blind. 
These works were interspersed with instruc- 
tions given to His disciples. The Pharisees 
asked a sign, and with a sigh He declared that 
none should be given. Finally He gathered 
His own about Him at Caesarea Philippi and 
the issue was that of Peter's confession. Thus 
through all this section Jesus is seen cease- 
lessly occupied in service, and calling into fel- 
lowship with Himself men who, while lovingly 
loyal, yet so imperfectly understood Him as 
to be unable to enter in full measure into the 
sacred comradeship. 



Jesus Christ the Servant 35 



c. Sacrifice 

In the final division the ministry of service 
merges into its highest sphere, that of sacri- 
fice. Again there are three sections, which 
deal with sacrifice anticipated, approached, 
and accomplished. 

Immediately after the confession at Cae- 
sarea the Master began to speak to His own 
disciples concerning His Cross, and they were 
filled with fear. The people were thronging 
Him still, and in their hearing He uttered 
words the infinite meaning of which neither 
they nor the disciples knew at the time, in- 
sisting upon the absolute necessity that men 
following Him should do so by the way of 
self-denial and the Cross. From the number 
of His disciples He selected three to be *^eye- 
witnesses of His glory." Passing down from 
the "holy mount" they were surrounded by 
the multitudes, and His power was manifested 
in His healing of the boy possessed of an evil 
spirit. With the departure of the crowds the 
disciples inquired as to the reason of their 
failure in dealing with this case. Answering 
them directly He led them forth quietly, and 
as far as possible privately, tl\,^ugh Galilee in 
order that He might teach \ ^> still further 
concerning the Cross. At C^j^^iariiaxim He re- 






36 Mark 

buked their disputation concerning greatness, 
and uttered some of the most solemn words 
that ever fell from His lips as to the necessity 
for the renunciation of everything which 
would be likely to prevent the highest realiza- 
tion of life. Coming into the borders of 
Judaea He answered the Pharisee's question 
concerning divorce, and immediately after- 
wards received the children and blessed them ; 
and then dealt with the young ruler, and an- 
swered the question of the disciples concern- 
ing the mystery of His dealing with him. Thus 
He passed on. His face set toward Jerusalem, 
walking alone, while His disciples followed 
behind. Yet He waited for them, and in- 
structed them further concerning His Cross, 
and two of their number asked for positions 
of power. The last picture in this section in 
which the Cross is so evidently anticipated is 
that of Jesus responding to a cry of need as 
He healed Bartimseus, and thus added another 
to the company of disciples who followed in 
His train. 

In the next section the Lord is seen with 
definite determination approaching the final 
sacrifice of Calvary. The happenings are all 
in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem. In his 
story of the t ^j Mark gives none of the 
effects produc upon Jerusalem and the 



Jesus Christ the Servant 87 

Pharisees, save those which reveal the recogni- 
tion of His Kingship. That is remarkable in 
the light of the fact that this is the gospel of 
the Servant. Yet it is in perfect harmony 
with Christ's own teaching that the Chief of 
men is so by virtue of being the Servant of all. 
The cursing of the fig-tree, and His explana- 
tion of the act are separated by the story of 
the cleansing of the Temple. The pretext for 
selling and money-changing was that of ren- 
dering service to worshippers. This was car- 
ried on in the Court of the Gentiles, who were 
thus robbed of the right to their place of wor- 
ship. This explains Christ's words, "a house 
of prayer for all nations." There was no 
home for Him in His city, and no rest for Him 
in His house. Therefore "every evening He 
went forth out of the city." He came into 
final conflict with the rulers as they chal- 
lenged Him as to His authority for cleansing 
the Temple. That challenge He answered by 
uttering the parable of the vineyard. Calmly 
He told them of His own casting out at their 
hands, and announced in fulfilment of proph- 
ecy His final victory as Chief of the corner. 
With magnificent ease He dealt in turn with 
the attacks of Pharisees and Herodians, of 
Sadducees and the lawyer. Having silenced 
these rulers He solemnly warned the people 



38 Mark 

against the scribes, and the contrast between 
the popular view of them and His estimate is 
most remarkable. 

Mark then chronicles His instructions to 
His disciples concerning giving, and concern- 
ing things to come. As the hour approached 
for the final movements of sacrifice two oppos- 
ing forces were working in different ways to- 
ward the same end. Judas plotted with the 
chief members of the Sanhedrin for the de- 
struction of Jesus; Jesus prepared for the se- 
clusion necessary to the delivery of His last 
discourses and the eating of the passover. At 
last He and His ow^n approached Gethsemane. 
No apostle witnessed its agony. Heaven and 
hell watched the confiict. None can fathom 
its mystery, and darkness, and suffering; the 
sense of death, the w^eight of sin, the awful 
fear. We are bowed to the dust in its pres- 
ence as we remember that our sin is its ex- 
planation. 

The last section of this division and indeed 
of the whole gospel, tells the story of the ac- 
complishment of sacrifice. The solemn and 
awful solitude of Gethsemane was disturbed 
by the coming of the traitor. All the worlds 
touched by man are represented in the Garden. 
Hell let loose in the priest-inspired rabble, 
led by Judas, himself "a devil," on whose face 



Jesus Christ the Servant 39 

is depicted the feverish fierceness of fear. 
Earth trembling, cowardly, and impetuous, in 
the disciples in folly and flight, led by Peter. 
Heaven quiet, calm, regal, in the Person of the 
Son of Man, the Servant of God. Again in 
solemn silence we ponder the story of His 
death. Its reaches go far out beyond our 
dreams. It is well to be silent. Joseph of 
Arimathaea, according to Hebrew law, con- 
tracted defilement by coming into the presence 
of Pilate, and so made it impossible for him to 
take part in the approaching feast. That de- 
filement was made deeper by his contact with 
the Dead. Yet what keeping of the feast he 
had, in that he cared with tender hands for 
the Holy One of God, Who was never to see 
corruption ! 

Mark's story closes as it began. One brief 
chapter in our Bible contains the story of res- 
urrection, of the days in which He tarried on 
the earth, of His glorious ascension. There 
is a calm dignity about the brief account of 
the ascension, which is a most appropriate end 
to the gospel of the Servant. He sat down at 
the right hand of God, His service ended, and 
so rendered that the most fitting place for Him 
is the place of highest honour, the Servant of 
God took the place of Chief of all. Yet His 
triumph did not issue in cessation of activity, 



40 Mark 

for as His servants, in obedience to His part- 
ing instructions, went forward to preach the 
Word everywhere, He worked with them, and 
gave the signs which confirmed the truth of 
their message. The last manifestation of the 
grace which had been so conspicuous in per- 
sonal service was that He sent His disciples 
forth to carry on His work, while He accom- 
panied them.

LUKE 

LUKE was a Greek and a physician. He 
wrote moreover to a Greek, his friend 
Theophilus. These facts enable us to ap- 
preciate his standpoint, and thus to ap- 
proach the study of this gospel intelligently. 
The Greek ideal was that of the perfection of 
the individual, and Luke sets Jesus before us 
in all the perfection of His human nature, 
showing how it transcends, by virtue of the 
work He accomplished, anything which the 
highest conceptions of Greek culture had ever 
conceived. His presentation of Jesus falls 
into three distinct parts, in which he shows 
Him as Perfect (i.-iii.) ; Perfected (iv.-ix. 36) ; 
Perfecting (ix, 37-xiiv.). 

A. Perfect 

The opening paragraph constitutes a pro- 
logue, in which Luke carefully stated the 
method of his writing, giving the sources of 
his information, and declaring that he had 
"traced the course of all things accurately." 
That is pre-eminently the method of the artist 

48 



44 Luke 

who from a mass of material produces an 
orderly statement. 

Following that method, he first presented 
the Person of Jesus in three movements; His 
being and birth; His childhood and confirma- 
tion; His development and anointing. 

As to the first, he gave the account of the 
angelic annunciations, which account was im- 
mediately followed by that of the songs of the 
Mothers, and of the birth of Jesus. Thus he 
dealt first with the physical side, showing that 
this Child came into human nature, but not 
as the result of human will or act. 

The next picture presents the Child at about 
twelve years of age, when according to 
Hebrew custom. He was presented for con- 
firmation, and became a son of the law. The 
outstanding impression is that of the mental, 
as with perfect naturalness, in questions and 
answers, He revealed an intellectual capac- 
ity which astonished the rulers of His people. 

The final movement in this division tells 
the story of the baptism and anointing of 
Jesus. Here the special revelation is that of 
the spiritual perfection of the Man as He set 
His face toward His life work. Thus the 
threefold perfection of Jesus is set forth. 

In connection with the last of these three 
movements, Luke gave an account of the min- 



Jesus Christ the Man 45 

istry of John, which is followed by the gen- 
ealogy which traced the descent of Jesus, even 
on the human side, through all mediating men ^ 
to God Himself. 

B. Perfected 

Having thus shown what may be termed 
the natural perfection of Jesus, Luke pro- 
ceeded to tell the story of how He was per- 
fected by processes of testing. Of these there 
were three; that of temptation, in which He 
dealt with the under-world of evil in the per- 
son of its prince, the devil; that of teaching, 
in which He dealt with the world of men 
about Him; and that of transfiguration, in 
which the supreme value is the revelation of 
His relation to God. 

The first of these was a process in which, 
led by the Spirit, He challenged evil, and sus- 
tained by the Spirit, met all its onslaughts, 
and gained full and final victory. The whole 
temptation was in the realm of the manhood 
of Jesus. The words with which He rebutted 
the attacks of Satan were quotations from the 
Divine law for the government of human life. 
He deliberately abode in the will of God as 
revealed in that law, and so overcame the 
enemy at every point. The issue Luke de- 
clared in the words, "When the devil had com- 



46 Luke 

pleted every temptation, he departed from 
Him for a season," and "Jesus returned in 
the power of the Spirit into Galilee . . . and 
taught." This statement reveals the exhaus- 
tive nature of helPs onslaught; but the thor- 
oughness of the temptation is the complete- 
ness of the victory. 

The second process and issue reveals the 
perfecting of Jesus in relation to men. In the 
synagogue at Nazareth with which He was 
perfectly familiar from youthful association. 
Pie claimed the fulfilment of prophecy in His 
own Person, and was immediately rejected as 
the men of Nazareth attempted to do Him 
violence. Luke next gave a series of pictures 
revealing different aspects of His work in 
Capernaum; teaching, mastery over demons 
and disease, and healing of all who came to 
Him. 

He then told how Jesus called the twelve 
into a mountain, and appointed them to 
apostolic ofl&ce and service; and passing from 
the mountain came with them into the midst 
of the multitudes, and repeated portions of the 
great manifesto which Matthew records as 
having been given at an earlier point in His 
ministry. Jesus then passed over the national 
barrier and brought blessing to the house of a 
itoman centurion. The next picture is that 



Jesus Christ the Man 47 

of the meeting, in the gateway at Nain, be- 
tween death and the Lord of life, with the 
transformation of the procession of death and 
sorrow, into the triumphant march of life and 
joy. Following is the account of John's in- 
quiry, with Christ's answer and consequent 
address to the multitudes; then the story of 
the scene in the house of Simon, and the ac- 
count of His journeying with the twelve 
through cities and villages, teaching both by 
parables and miracles. 

Finally, the twelve were sent forth alone 
on a mission from which they returned flushed 
with victory. He led them apart, ultimately 
to Csesarea Philippi. There the confession of 
Peter illustrated his perfection as a Teacher, 
as it declared the essential truth concerning 
Him. Jesus immediately commenced the 
second stage in the training of His own dis- 
ciples, as turning toward the supreme work 
of the Cross, He prepared them by announc- 
ing it to them. 

The third and last process and issue, that of 
transfiguration, would perhaps be more ac- 
curately described as an issue resulting from 
the process of all so far considered. The story 
of the transfiguration is that of the coming to 
final perfection of the human nature of Jesus. 
Up to this point the life had been probation- 



48 Luke 

ary. A perfect instrument had nevertheless 
been subjected to the testing of temptation, 
and of responsibility. In both He had been 
victorious, mastering all attacks made upon 
Him by the under-world of evil, and living 
so absolutely at the disposal of God, as to have 
been the Instrument through which light had 
shined upon others. Thus through innocence 
and holiness He came to that transfiguration, 
or metamorphosis, by which without death He, 
in His humanity, was prepared to pass from 
the earthly scene into all the larger spaces 
of the life that lay beyond. In the glory of 
this mountain we see Him revealing the ulti- 
mate intention of God, and the consequent 
consummation of human nature. The con- 
trast between this Man and all other men 
who must pass to death because of sin, became 
most vivid in this hour. At this point in the 
narrative of Luke the utmost reach of the 
Greek ideal was realized. This is the abso- 
lutely perfect human Being. All the rest of 
the story has to do with sacrificial work on be- 
half of others. 

c. Perfecting 

The Greek teachers had recognized the 
necessity for sacrifice in order to the realiza- 
tion of personal perfection, but that a per- 



Jesus Christ the Man 49 

feet One should suffer for the imperfect was 
new, and this is the story of the last division 
of the gospel. 

Fittingly Luke placed the story of the heal- 
ing of the demon-possessed boy immediately 
following the account of the transfiguration. 
The only begotten Son of God met an only be- 
gotten son of man. Raving turned His back 
upon His right of entry to the larger life, de- 
scending into the valley, He came into contact 
with one, devil-possessed, and so prevented 
from the possibility of entering into the life 
that now is. Immediately He cast the devil 
forth, and gave tbe boy back to his father. It 
was a symbolic miracle, suggesting that work 
to which He was now passing, as His face wsm 
toward the Cross ; and became the occasion of 
a conversation with His disciples in which He 
corrected their false views of greatness and of 
dignity. 

This last division is centred in the Cross, 
and falls into three parts. The first deals with 
the purpose and preparation ; the second with 
the approach and accomplishment; and the 
last with the administration. 

The purpose is declared in the words, 
"When the days were well-nigh come that He 
should be received up. He steadfastly set His 
face to go to Jerusalem." That is the key to 



50 Luke 

all that follows in this section. Anything in 
the nature of detailed analysis is almost im- 
possible. The Prophet Priest is seen pressing 
resolutely and yet quietly on toward the city 
and the Cross. On the way He was perpetu- 
ally occupied in correcting all kinds of mis- 
takes made by all kinds of people; and in- 
structing as He went. In turn He dealt with 
His disciples concerning varied matters; ad- 
dressed the multitudes, and manifested His 
power on their behalf; rebuked the rulers as 
responsible; answered the criticism of His 
enemies; and scattered helpful words and 
beneficent deeds among the people, according 
to their individual requirements. It was 
wholly a ministry of prophecy, revealing su- 
perlatively the darkness in which the people 
w^ere living, flinging up into startling distinct- 
ness the sins of the time, and thus supremely 
and overwhelmingly revealing the necessity 
for that very work, the accomplishment of 
which was the reason of His first coming ; and 
moreover, of His recent descent from the 
mount of transfiguration. The perfect One, 
perfected to demonstration in the process of 
His own life, is now seen doing the prepara- 
tory work in order to the perfecting of those 
who need His help. 

The next section commences with the words, 



Jesus Christ the Man 51 

"He took unto Him the twelve, and said unto 
them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem," and 
with the declarations He made in connection 
therewith. It may be analyzed around this 
affirmation of Jesus. Thus we have first the 
account of the immediate approach, as He and 
His disciples took their w^ay through Jericho 
to Jerusalem. On the journey He healed Bar- 
timaeus, and entering into the house of Zac- 
chaeus excited the astonishment and opposi- 
tion of those who observed Him. Because He 
was nigh the city, He uttered the parable 
which predicted His own rejection, and indi- 
cated the responsibility which would rest 
upon His representatives after He had gone. 
At last He entered the city itself, in the midst 
of acclamations; and His own attitude is re- 
vealed in a wonderful merging of tenderness 
and terror, as He swept over the city, and ut- 
tered the prediction of its coming doom. 

Then follows the account of how He was 
"delivered to the Gentiles." His first act was 
to cleanse the Temple. This was followed by 
the criticism and questioning of the authori- 
ties, to which He replied directly, accompany- 
ing His answers by parables of denunciation. 
Then came the beginning of the end. The 
priests and the devil are seen in coalition. 
Their one central work was to get rid of Jesus. 



52 Luke 

They were afraid of the people, but at last 
they gained their vote and crucified Him. He 
gathered His apostles about Him, and the 
shadow of the ancient ceremonial ritual was 
merged in the substance of the new Feast. He 
gave them fresh instructions, which indicated 
the necessity henceforth for forethought and 
arrangement in all their service for Him. 

Luke now brings us into the land of 
shadows. In Gethsemane we see Jesus keenly 
alive to the terrible nature of the passion 
baptism, but resolutely abandoned still to His 
Father's will. Immediately all the storm of 
the malice of devils and the sin of man broke 
upon His head. Judas the betrayer kissed 
Him to death. Peter the boaster blundered 
with a sword, followed afar, and finally pol- 
luted the night air with blasphemy. The serv- 
ants that held Him mocked and beat Him. 
The council formally and definitely rejected 
Him. Nevertheless the figure of the Christ is 
still commanding and arresting. He passed 
through this hour with the firm step of a Con- 
queror. To Judas He spoke strong and awful 
words, which opened perdition before him. 
Peter He looked back to penitence and tears. 
In the hands of brutality He opened not His 
mouth. To the council He formally declared 
His high office, and coming dignity. Out of 



Jesus Christ the Man 58 

the hour and power of darkness He brought 
light and victory for all the enslaved; and 
proved that in the toils of His foes, and in 
the extremity of His weakness, He was yet 
mightier than all the power of the adversary ; 
and by victory won through defeat He turned 
the hour of darkness into the daybreak of the 
race. Two men saw Jesus for the first time, 
Pilate and Herod. The one sold his con- 
science to save his position. The other, hav- 
ing no conscience left, endeavoured to satisfy 
his morbid sensual curiosity with a new thrill, 
and the only thrill he gained was the tragic 
silence of the Son of God. 

The story of the Cross itself is told by Luke 
with sublime simplicity. We stand again on 
the margin of the sea of unutterable anguish, 
and remember that His submerging was for 
our rescue. What it meant to Him of suffer- 
ing, and to us of deliverance, is only under- 
stood as w^e remember that He exhausted all 
the force of its sweeping waters ; and we now 
stand on the far side with Him, singing the 
triumph song of those whose judgment is 
passed, and whose heaven is won. What 
mingled feelings of disappointment and love 
must have filled the heart of Joseph as he 
laid the body of Jesus in his garden grave. 
Thank God for ever, for the love of this heart 



54 Luke 

that found resting-place for the sacred body 
which was never to see corruption. 

And thus we reach "the third day." No 
human eye saw the resurrection. The failure 
of the disciples to believe Him concerning His 
return out of death prevented their watching 
for it, and the keepers were not permitted to 
behold; for emerging from the grave-clothes, 
without discomposing them. He left the tomb 
before the stone was rolled away. Yet while 
no human eye saw the daybreak, men every- 
where were soon to walk in the full light of the 
glorious day. 

The last page of Luke's gospel gives us some 
suggestive glimpses of the personal adminis- 
tration of the priestly work of Jesus. All 
the appearances were to His own, and all He 
did was on their behalf. The story of the 
walk to Emmaus is full of fascination. Two 
men in unbelief, and yet in love declared, 
"We hoped that it was He which should re- 
deem Israel." To them He gave new inter- 
pretation of the Scriptures with which they 
were familiar, which created a burning of 
heart, which consisted in the kindling of a 
new passion for Him, and for the enterprises 
of His heart. 

Then with startling abruptness He revealed 
to them the new comradeship existing between 



Jesus Christ the Man 55 

them, which created their confidence for all 
the coming days. Coming into their midst 
through closed doors, He invited them to see 
His hands and His feet, and know that it was 
He Himself, and moreover, He ate a piece of 
broiled fish. 

He then gave them a commission which in- 
dicated the relation of all the past and the 
future in the economy of God to Himself; the 
ancient writings, the law of Moses, and the 
prophets, and the psalms concerned Him. 
Their ultimate message was of His suffering 
and resurrection. In order to the preaching 
of repentance and remission to all the nations, 
His disciples were first to enter into the ex- 
perience, and so to become witnesses. 

The last vision of Him is that of hands out- 
stretched in priestly benediction as He left 
them, in consequence of which they returned 
to the Temple and to worship; thus, through 
His priesthood, fulfilling their own.

JOHN 

JOHN was a mystic in all the highest 
senses of the word. Conscious at once 
of the things patent, and of that vast realm 
of the spiritual, of which the material is but 
a partial and transitory manifestation, he 
came into fellowship with the profoundest 
things in the Person of his Lord. Turning to 
the gospel according to John, we find our- 
selves immediately compelled to worship. 
The same personality is presented to us as that 
with which we have grown familiar in the 
earlier stories. From the beginning, however, 
we are conscious of a new assertion on the 
part of the writer, and a new quality about 
the Person. As we proceed, we find that the 
change is not that of difference, but an unveil- 
ing and explanation. The revelation of this 
gospel is that of God manifest in fiesh. The 
central division dealing with this is intro- 
duced by a brief but pregnant one, showing 
how the Word came from the everlasting con- 
ditions into those of time and human sense; 
and is followed by one presenting Him in the 
new everlasting conditions arising out of His 

59 



60 John 

incarnate presence in human history. These 
divisions therefore may thus be stated : From 
Everlasting (i. 1-18) ; God Manifest (i. 19- 
xix.) ; To Everlasting (ix., xxi.). 

A. From Everlasting 

In the study of this division it is necessary 
that the first and fourteenth verses should be 
read in connection. The first declares the 
everlasting relation of the Word; the four- 
teenth the fact of His temporal manifestation. 
In each statement there are three parts, those 
of the first being immediately related to those 
of the second. 

Lying between the two verses referred to, 
the glories of the Word are dealt with in the 
varied processes of God's relation to hu- 
manity. All creation has proceeded through 
Him. All life has been derived from Him, and 
the inner light of humanity has ever been His 
shining within the consciousness of the race. 

Following this preliminary paragraph the 
evangelist recorded the double witness of 
John the prophet, and John the apostle, the 
messages of hope and realization, respectively. 

The final verse announces the evangel, and 
constitutes a key to all that is to follow. The 
evident need of man is the vision of God. 
This he lacks. It is granted to him through 



Jesus Christ the Word of God 61 

the Son Who speaks from the bosom of the 
Father. 

B. God Manifest 

The main division of the gospel deals with 
the Word as the manifestation of God in time. 
It has three sections — manifestation in the 
world, manifestation to His own, manifesta- 
tion by the Cross. 

The manifestation in the world is intro- 
duced by a prologue, giving the account of the 
ministry of John the Baptist, and of the gath- 
ering of the first disciples of Jesus. In re- 
sponse to the inquiry of the rulers, the herald 
directed their attention to Another than him- 
self, identifying Him as the Lamb of God, 
which description, to be appreciated at its 
true value, must be heard with the ear of the 
Eastern. The Lamb was suggestive of sacri- 
fice, and this is emphatically declared in the 
statement, "Who taketh away the sin of the 
world." 

There immediately follows the account of 
the gathering to the Lord of His first disciples. 
Men are seen finding the One for Whom men 
everywhere are waiting. They came seeking 
Messiah, and found that He had already 
found them. 

We now approach the actual manifestation 



62 John 

in the world. Yet here again John grouped 
some initial signs and wonders in order to in- 
troduce the more formal showing. This 
grouping is full of artistic and spiritual 
beauty. The matters dealt with have to do 
with life and light, and move in an interesting 
circle. The first sign was that of life in its 
creative power, exercised at Cana, in turning 
water into wine. This was followed by the 
wonder of light manifested in Jerusalem upon 
the great subject of worship, first in the 
cleansing of the temple as the House of God, 
and in the interests of Gentile worshippers 
who had been excluded by the traffic estab- 
lished in the courts; and then in the instruc- 
tion of a man, honest, sincere, and inquiring, 
as to the deeper meanings of the Kingdom of 
God, and the possibility of human entrance 
thereto. After this first sign and wonder at 
Jerusalem, the evangelist introduced the 
double witness of John the prophet, and of 
himself, John the apostle. The former was 
the last voice of the old dispensation, and con- 
stitutes a dignified recessional, culminating in 
the declaration, "He must increase; but I 
must decrease." The latter was the experi- 
mental declaration of the new, and constitutes 
a triumphal processional, ending with the 
declaration, "He that believeth on the Son 



Jesus Christ the Word of God 63 

hath eternal life; but he that obeyeth not the 
Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God 
abideth on him.'' Then sweeping on in his 
circle, and so returning toward the point from 
which he started, he recorded the wonder 
of light in the spiritual illumination of a 
woman in Samaria, and her instruction as to 
the deepest meaning of worship; and return- 
ing to Cana described the second sign 
which revealed life operating in restoration. 
Whereas in the first division of the gospel the 
cosmic relations of Christ are set forth in 
their voidest reaches, in this introduction to 
the formal showing, His relation to human 
life and history is set forth. 

The formal showing consists of the group- 
ing of such works and words as show the 
Word manifesting God in life, and light, and 
love. 

The manifestation of life is threefold. It 
is first shown as having its source in God, and 
mediatorially in His Son, Who is the Word. 
This is first set forth by the account of the 
healing of the man at the pool. On the Sab- 
bath day Jesus arrested and healed a man 
who for thirty and eight years had been in the 
grip of infirmity. This action was immedi- 
ately followed by controversy, in the course 
of which Christ claimed that what He had 



64 John 

done had been of the nature of co-operation 
with His Father, Whose Sabbath had been 
broken by man's sin. This claim stirred up 
their opposition, because in it He made Him- 
self equal with God^ In a discourse resulting 
from their criticism Jesus lifted the con- 
troversy into the highest realm as He declared 
His right to work this miracle on the Sabbath 
to be that of His fellowship with His Father, 
as Source of life. The key-verses of the dis- 
course are the twenty-first and the twenty- 
sixth. 

John recorded His fourth and fifth signs, 
the first that of the feeding of the multitude, 
and the second that of the stilling of the storm 
as the disciples crossed the sea to the other 
side. The outcome of the sign of the feeding 
of the multitude was the great discourse on 
the bread of life, in which rebuking them for 
their eagerness concerning material suste- 
nance. He declared Himself to be that Bread of 
life, out of heaven, which was necessary for 
the sustenance of life eternal. The sign of 
the stilling of the storm was for the disciples 
only, and was granted to them in an hour 
when in all probability they were both per- 
plexed and disappointed that He had not con- 
sented to be made King by popular acclaim 
on the basis of His power to feed the multi- 



Jesus Christ the Word of God 65 

tudes with material bread. They were shown 
thereby His power over Nature. The claim of 
Christ to be the Bread of life gave rise to per- 
plexity in the minds both of the Jews, and of 
His own disciples, each of which stated their 
dijBficulties, and Christ dealt with them in 
turn. The teaching was on so high a level as 
to sift the ranks even of the disciples, many 
going back to walk no more with Him. 

In the next section the Word is revealed as 
the Satisfaction of life. The central declara- 
tion is that of Christ's invitation on the last 
day of the Feast of Tabernacles, in which He 
challenged all human need under the figure 
of thirst, and claimed to be able perfectly to 
satisfy it. The effect of the manifestation is 
seen in the disputes and divisions occurring as 
the result of His teaching. Through all this 
the positive theme is developed as Jesus an- 
swered questions and corrected misapprehen- 
sions. 

The record now deals with the Word as 
light. This section is introduced by a para- 
graph universally conceded to have been 
added by a later hand than that of John. In 
set discourse Jesus definitely claimed to be 
Light, maintaining His claim in the contro- 
versy which followed. This claim was then 
illustrated by the introduction of the account 



66 John 

of the miracle wrought on the blind man. 
Jesus is recorded to have repeated His claim 
before bestowing on him his sight. The gift 
of sight was in itself symbolic of the mission 
of the Word in the midst of the darkness of 
human unbelief. The whole of the subsequent 
controversy gathered round the same idea, and 
the development in the testimony of the man 
to Christ is a remarkable illustration of the 
illumination of spiritual life by the Word of 
light. 

Finally, in the formal showing, we have the 
revelation of love. There is the closest con- 
nection between the subject of the section and 
that of the preceding one. In the former a 
man was excommunicat^^d by the rulers of the 
Jews because of his truthful testimony to 
what Christ had done for him. Being so ex- 
communicated Christ received him, and ac- 
cepted his worship. In the scheme of revela- 
tion His discourse concerning the new com- 
munity of believing souls is recorded, and in 
this He is seen in the ultimate revelation of 
His love, under the tender and beautiful 
figure of the Shepherd Who lays down His life 
for the sheep, first in the death by which He 
delivers them from the marauding wolf; and 
secondly in that infinite mystery by which 
through such death He takes the life again, 



Jesus Christ the Word of God 67 

and communicates it to them. The highest 
and final expression of love is found in this 
teaching, and the supreme declaration con- 
cerning the nature of God is made by Christ 
when He declared that His Father loved Him 
because He laid down His life, that He might 
take it again. This teaching was naturally 
followed by further controversy, in the course 
of which Jesus declared that the final argu- 
ment for those who did not know Him per- 
sonally, was that of His works. 

John now recorded the seventh and final 
sign in the manifestation in the world. It 
contains all the elements of love, of light, and 
of life; and makes a profound appeal, in that 
these essential things of God are seen in rela- 
tion to individuals and family life. The love 
is declared in the midst of circumstances 
which seem to contradict it. The home at 
Bethany had ever been open to Jesus ; and one 
of the family circle, the much-beloved brother, 
lay sick unto death. When appealed to, Jesus 
did not seem to respond with any earnestness, 
and yet in this connection the affirmation of 
love was made. Then as He went with His 
disciples toward the scene of sorrow, those 
who went with Him are seen walking in the 
light, and thus triumphing over appearances. 
Finally, at the grave of Lazarus the life had 



68 John 

its most remarkable revelation in the world 
in His words, "I am the resurrection/' and in 
His work as He raised Lazarus. 

The section dealing with the manifestation 
in the world ends with an epilogue, which 
gathers up in a series of movements the results 
following the ministry of Jesus. The effects 
upon His foes were seen in the plotting of the 
priests, and His inability to walk openly 
among the Jews. The effects upon His friends 
were seen as they gathered about Him at the 
social board, and were superlatively set forth 
in the anointing spikenard of Mary. The gen- 
eral issues among His own people, the Jews, 
were revealed in the curiosity which made 
them crowd to see Lazarus, and the fact that 
many of them believed on Him; and, finally, 
in the popular acclaim of the Galilseans as 
He rode into the midst of the hostile city of 
Jerusalem. Moreover, the interest of the Gen- 
tiles was seen beginning, as the Greeks came 
to Him, and He revealed the fact that it was 
necessary for them also to find Him by the 
way of the Cross. These illustrations and re- 
sults are followed by a summary. In that 
summary John first recorded the broad issues 
of the manifestation in the world. On the one 
hand, blind unbelief in fulfilment of the word 
spoken by Isaiah; and on the other, fearful 



J esus Christ the Word of God 69 

belief on the part of many who loved the glory 
of men more than the glory of God. Thus the 
epilogue is linked to the prologue. He then 
chronicled what perhaps were the last words 
uttered in the w^ay of public teaching and ap- 
peal by Jesus. 

The second movement in the manifestation 
of God by the Word now commences. In it 
are recorded the works and words in which 
Jesus dealt exclusively with His own. The es- 
sential revelations are the same, but they are 
now made to that inner circle of believing 
souls who are able to understand more per- 
fectly the Divine manifestation, and conse- 
quently they touch a profounder depth. 

The first section is pre-eminently an unveil- 
ing of His love. This took the form of a su- 
preme act of lowly service. Jesus laid aside 
His garments, and girded Himself with a 
towel — that is to say, He adopted the very 
badge of slavery. It was the most marvellous 
revelation of the love of God expressing itself 
in terms of service. Following this action He 
gave His disciples instruction concerning the 
perfected union between Himself and them, 
based upon love, and expressed in mutual 
service. In this connection occurred the 
solemn act of the exclusion of Judas. Love 
then proceeded to speak to them in terms cal- 



70 John 

culated to help them in view of the fact that 
He was about to leave them. This discourse 
was thrice interrupted by the inquiries of cer- 
tain of His disciples. 

The next section has pre-eminently to do 
with light, as it would be granted to His own 
by the coming of the Paraclete, consequent 
upon the completion of the work of the Word. 
The gift of the Spirit would be bestow^ed by 
the Father in answer to the intercession of 
Christ, and His office would be that of inter- 
preting the things of the Christ. Thus, 
through the going of Jesus, the disciples 
would pass into new light as well as into new 
realization of love. 

The last movement in the farewell dis- 
courses has to do with life. As in dealing with 
love He spoke of Himself; and with light, of 
the Spirit; so now in dealing with life He 
speaks of Himself perfected in His own by the 
Spirit. The new union is illustrated by the 
figure of the vine, and He emphasized the con- 
ditions upon which the disciples would become 
fruitful. The truth thus symbolized of the re- 
lation of the disciples to Himself in the bond 
of life He then spoke of in greater detail as 
to its purpose, its law, its relation, and its 
appointment; and finally communicated the 
value of this relationship for the world. Un- 



Jesus Christ the Word of God 71 

der the law of love His own would have fel- 
lowship with Him in suffering, and fellowship 
with the Spirit in witness. This led on to a 
declaration of the work of the Spirit in the 
world; and consequently of the work of the 
Spirit in equipping the disciples for the fulfil- 
ment of their work in the world. These final 
discourses to His own ended with His gracious 
declaration that the sorrow of His going 
would soon be turned into new joy ; a summary 
of the meaning of His mission; and a last 
word of warning. 

Following the discourses we have the great 
prayer of the Word. This again follows the 
threefold line of life, of light, and of love. 
The essential fact of life is unfolded as He 
spoke of His relation to His Father, and ut- 
tered His own petition. The fact of light is 
revealed as He spoke of His relation to the 
men by whom He was surrounded, and uttered 
His petitions for them. The fact of love is 
supremely evident in His prayer for the 
Church, which also thrills with His care for 
the world. He prayed for the unity of His 
own, that the world might believe, and that 
the world might know ; and for their ultimate 
perfecting by being with Him and beholding 
His glory in the ages to come. 

The final movement in the manifestation of 



72 John 

God by the Word describes that manifestation 
by the Cross. It is first an unveiling of love, 
deserted and yet faithful. Love is now seen 
at its mightiest as it proceeds in strength 
through weakness. Voluntarily, and yet with 
the movement of a Conqueror, He bends to 
suffering. All this is revealed in the story of 
the betrayal, and of the two trial scenes. 
While the foes of the Word opposed, the 
friends failed; and Pilate, neither friend nor 
foe, sacrificed justice in the interests of self- 
preservation. 

At the centre of the manifestation by the 
Cross light is eclipsed, and yet flashes forth 
in new radiance. The darkness gathers as 
men crucify, while yet the attitude of the 
Word, and the two sayings from the Cross 
chronicled by John, suggest dawning rather 
than eclipse, victory rather than defeat. 

The final fact in the manifestation by the 
Cross is that of life laid down and yet thus 
given. The pent-up suffering of the long 
hours found vent in one brief and fearful cry, 
"I thirst" ; and the victory in the mightiest of 
all cries, "It is finished." In sublimity and 
simplicity John chronicled the most stupen- 
dous fact in human history in the words, "They 
crucified Him." There is no detailed descrip- 
tion, and again the only fitting attitude is that 



Jesus Christ the Word of God 73 

of the subdued spirit, which, in consciousness 
of the terribleness of the scene, shuts it out 
from all curious contemplation. Sorrow is 
crowned as to its measure, for never was such 
before or since; as to its value, for the cup 
there drained to the dregs will for evermore 
overflow with the elixir of a new life for a 
death-doomed race. Exquisitely beautiful is 
the story of His burial. After the accomplish- 
ment of the redemptive work, God suffered no 
rude hand to touch even the dead body of the 
Man of manifestation. Two secret disciples 
paid the last tender offices of respect to their 
Lord. Joseph found Him a grave in a garden, 
and Nicodemus brought wealth of spices for 
His entombment. 

c. To Everlasting 

The last division of the gospel is brief but 
full of suggestion and value. As the first di- 
vision declared the way by which the Word 
came from ages past into time, this reveals the 
abiding conditions of the Word toward His 
own in all the ages to come. Abiding life is 
manifest in the empty tomb and the living 
Lord. Abiding light is seen in His appear- 
ances to His disciples, and His patience with 
Thomas. Abiding love has manifestation 
which touches the simplest and sublimest 



74 John 

things of human life. Its interest in material 
necessity is seen in the breakfast provided 
for toil-tired fishermen. Its provision for all 
spiritual need is seen in its dealing with Peter. 
John closed as he began. His first state- 
ment concerned the eternal Word. His last 
declares that words can never express all the 
facts, even of His tabernacling in the flesh. 
Thus as at the beginning we stood in wonder 
in the presence of the bewildering eternities, 
at the close we stand in amazement in view 
of the infinitudes which have yet been con- 
densed into manifestation in a Person upon 
Whom we may look, to Whom we may listen, 
Whom indeed we may handle, and yet Who for 
ever defies any to say all that is to be said 
concerning Him.

ACTS 

LUKE is the author of this book, and, as 
the opening words indicate, he intended 
that it should be a companion to his "former 
treatise," and, indeed, a continuation of the 
story told therein. The gospels have been 
principally occupied with the Person of 
Christ, while they have also declared so much 
of His doing and teaching as was necessary 
for the understanding of His work. The book 
called the Acts of the Apostles is principally 
occupied with the beginnings of that more per- 
fect unfolding of His teaching, and that 
mightier operation of His power, consequent 
upon the accomplishment of the work of the 
Cross. In the gospels we have seen the per- 
fection of His Person, but both as to doing 
and teaching He has been limited, as He Him- 
self said, "But I have a baptism to be baptized 
with; and how am I straitened till it be ac- 
complished!" (Luke xii. 50). "I have yet 
many things to say unto you, but ye cannot 
bear them now. Howbeit when He, the Spirit 
of Truth is come. He shall guide you into all 
the truth" (John xvi. 12, 13). 

77 



78 Acts 

In this book we see Him in the unstraitened 
power, resulting from the accomplishment of 
His exodus, working by the Spirit through 
the Church; and we hear His voice speaking 
through the Spirit to the Church ; and through 
the Spirit and the Church to the world. Per- 
haps the title more correctly indicating the 
true scope of the book would be, the Beginning 
of the Doing and Teaching of Christ, by the 
Spirit, through the Church. It falls into two 
unequal parts as to quantity, the first being 
absolutely necessary to an understanding of 
the second, the second revealing the issues of 
the events chronicled in the first; the Church 
formed (i.-ii. 4) ; the Church witnessing (ii. 
5-xxviii. ) . 

A. The Church formed 

After referring to his former treatise, and 
in a few brief sentences epitomizing its con- 
tents, Luke first presents us with a last 
glimpse of the old conditions. Christ was still 
alone, in that His disciples did not yet under- 
stand the real meaning of His mission, or of 
their own. They inquired as to whether He 
would now restore the kingdom to Israel, and 
He corrected the false thinking by declaring 
Himself to be a new Centre, and that they 
would be witnesses to Him, not to Israel only. 



The Church Formed and Witnessing 79 

but to the uttermost part of the earth. After 
His ascension, the disciples waited in obedi- 
ence to His command, because they were un- 
equal to the carrying on of His work, or the 
delivery of His message, until the Spirit had 
been poured out upon them. 

The account of the formation of the Church 
needs little exposition. It is brief and sub- 
lime, and yet perfectly simple. In the upper 
room was a company of units, all together as 
to bodily association, yet separated from the 
Lord and from each other. By the mighty 
fire-baptism of the Holy Spirit, the separated 
units were fused into one unity. Every indi- 
vidual member was joined to Christ, and so 
all shared the common life, thus becoming an 
organism through which Christ was able to 
carry on His work. In that hour began the 
new and unlimited ministry of Christ, by the 
Spirit, in and through His own, for the sake 
of the world. 

B. The Church witnessing 

The second division stands in close relation 
to the commission of Jesus as recorded in the 
first. He declared that they should be His 
witnesses "in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea and 
Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the 



80 Acts 

earth.'' The story of the witnessing of the 
early Church is told in that order. 

The first section gives an account of the wit- 
ness of the Church in Jerusalem, and is of 
perpetual interest as it reveals the first things. 
The first impression produced upon the city 
was that of amazement, perplexity, and criti- 
cism. This was immediately followed by the 
first message delivered in the power of the out- 
poured Spirit. In it there are two main facts 
noticeable. First, Peter's use of Old Testa- 
ment Scriptures; and secondly, his clear dec- 
larations concerning Jesus of Nazareth. He 
connected the strange happenings of that 
wonderful day with the foretelling of their 
own Scriptures, and so made evident the fact 
that the new was the continuation and con- 
summation of the old. He then proceeded to 
show that the result had been achieved 
through the Man of Nazareth, Whom they 
had rejected. The result of the message was 
glorious and immediate. It produced con- 
viction, which under instruction, resulted in 
conversion. 

The next section tells the story of the first 
opposition, showing its cause, its instigators, 
and its effect. The healing of a man at the 
Temple gate, Peter distinctly attributed to the 
immediate power of the risen Christ. Opposi- 



The Church Formed and Witnessmg 81 

tion at once followed, caused by this clear tes- 
timony of the apostles to the resurrection, and 
instigated by the priests. For the first time 
the apostles are seen on their trial. There 
was no definite charge preferred against them. 
It was rather a court of inquiry before which 
they stood, instituted evidently with a desire 
to find a charge. Peter's answer was remark- 
able for its splendid daring and absolute defi- 
niteness. Being released, the apostles re- 
joined their own company, and all betook 
themselves to prayer, asking for boldness. 
The answer was sudden and startling, the 
place being shaken, and themselves filled with 
the Spirit. This was not a second Pentecost; 
but rather the gracious manifestation of the 
continued presence of the Spirit in the hour 
of a grave danger. Their fear was abandoned, 
and their courage renewed. 

If the Name was persecuted from without, 
within there was the realization of a most de- 
lightful fellowship. Under the Lordship of 
Christ, and having His mind, these early dis- 
ciples emptied themselves, and served each 
other. The basis of the first communism was 
that of the essential spiritual unity of the dis- 
ciples. They were of one heart and one soul. 
Its method was that of apostolic distribution, 
according to the need of individual members- 



82 Acts 

One notable instance is given, that of Barna- 
bas, who in a magnificent venture of faith 
sold his land, and laid the proceeds at the feet 
of the apostles. 

The story of the judgment of Ananias and 
Sapphira is that of the first discipline, and 
utters its solemn warning to all who may be 
tempted to make an outward profession which 
is not in keeping with the inward fact and ex- 
perience. It constitutes an almost overwhelm- 
ing revelation of the awful atmosphere of 
purity, which made impossible the presence 
of hypocrisy and deceit within the borders of 
the early Church. 

At last the opposition flamed into actual 
persecution. Its inspiration was Sadducean. 
The new movement was essentially spiritual. 
The Sadducees were wholly rationalistic. 
The scene presented at the trial is remarkably 
vivid. On the one side the most august and 
representative assembly that Judaism could 
bring together ; on the other a handful of men, 
not one of their number a man of mark or 
note, judged by the standard of the time; yet 
men whose names were to live, and whose 
work was to abide, while the others have only 
found a place in human history because of 
their connection with these despised followers 
of Jesus. As a piece of human wisdom Gama- 



The Church Formed and Witnessing 83 

liel's advice was excellent, but it was impos- 
sible that it should be followed. The claims 
of Christ are such that they cannot be let 
alone. 

The first organization grew out of murmur- 
ing within the fellowship. The appointment 
of deacons issued in the increase of the Word 
of God, and the multiplication of the number 
of the disciples. 

From the ranks of the diaconate a Christian 
martyr first sealed his testimony with his 
blood. The attack upon him was popular 
rather than priestly, and this was the first 
manifestation of such an outbreak. The 
charge against him was that of having spoken 
against the Temple, and his defence was an 
answer thereto. It consisted of a masterly 
review of the history of the nation, from the 
call of Abraham to the rejection of Jesus ; and 
was intended to emphasize the fact that God 
had never been limited or localized, that the 
Temple was merely a part of His method, 
which did not exist at the beginning of their 
history, and may now as surely be dispensed 
with. Such argument and directness could 
produce but one result. Convinced that his 
argument was unanswerable, their rage was 
stirred against him. The dying Stephen was 
granted a glorious vision of his Lord. He saw 



84 Acts 

Him standing, and thus fulfilling one aspect 
of His great priesthood. 

The popular outburst against Christianity 
was felt by the whole Church, and as a re- 
sult its members were scattered throughout 
Judaea and Samaria. Of this organized perse- 
cution, Saul of Tarsus was the appointed 
leader. Among the scattered witnesses, Philip, 
one of the recently chosen deacons, passed to 
the city of Samaria. The work under his 
ministry was one of arrest and conviction. A 
great company believed, among the number 
Simon the sorcerer, whose history stands as a 
warning against any attempts to procure the 
filling of the Spirit for merely selfish pur- 
poses. The apostolic visitation of the Samari- 
tans was followed by a tour through the 
villages. 

Then follows the last and largest section, 
which deals with the witness of the Church 
toward the uttermost part of the earth. One 
brief story tells how the evangel came into 
Africa. Philip acting under direct guidance 
took a journey of at least thirty miles to de- 
clare the Word to an Ethiopian eunuch. The 
issues are not chronicled, but the fact abides 
that that eunuch was one of the dark-skinned 
sons of Africa. 

The movement toward Asia commenced 



The Church Formed and Witnessing 85 

with the finding of the instrument. Saul, the 
appointed prosecutor of the Nazarene sect, 
while travelling in the interest of that ap- 
pointment, was, to use his own word, "appre- 
hended"; and henceforth became the Masters 
"chosen vessel unto the Gentiles." Instructed 
more perfectly in the Way by Ananias, he re- 
ceived the fulness of the Holy Spirit. The 
change of attitude in Saul immediately issued 
in a change of attitude toward him. The per- 
secutor was persecuted. At once the disciples 
who had feared him became his guardians, 
and made provision for his escape from the 
determined attempts that were being made on 
his life. 

At this point the history returns to Peter. 
He is seen busily occupied in his Master's 
service. "He went throughout all parts," and 
stories are told of his visits to Lydda and 
Joppa. Then commenced the larger move- 
ment of the witness to Jesus in connection 
with the conversion of Cornelius. God by 
special revelation attracted the first of the 
"all nations" toward the evangel; and by the 
same method prepared the first messenger to 
declare that evangel. In the house of Cor- 
nelius, Peter declared that there had come to 
him a new perception, breaking down his 
prejudices, and broadening his outlook. As he 



86 Acts 

spoke, the light that had broken out upon the 
ancient people on the day of Pentecost, flashed 
forth upon these, and the new converts were 
baptized by the Holy Ghost; and then as a 
sign of the essential baptism they were bap- 
tized in water. The prejudices of the Hebrew 
Christians gave way slowly, and Peter in Jeru- 
salem spoke in defence of his action, setting 
the fact of the Divine visitation against the 
theories of the critics. It is interesting to no- 
tice how amenable they were to the evidences 
as declared. 

Antioch now became the new base of opera- 
tions for missionary enterprise. The news of 
an apparently irregular proceeding there, 
reached the brethren in Jerusalem, and they 
sent down Barnabas for purposes of investiga- 
tion. Recognizing the movement as of God, he 
went to Tarsus to seek Saul, almost assuredly 
knowing that his special mission was to the 
Gentiles; and a year's work in Antioch fol- 
lowed under the direction of these two men. 

While this movement was in process of 
initiation, the Church in Jerusalem was pass- 
ing through a new period of persecution under 
Herod. Peter was imprisoned, and supernat- 
urally delivered. There is a graphic contrast 
incidentally revealed between the opposing 
forces; Herod, sensual and sinning, at last 



The Church Formed and Witnessing 87 

descended even to receiving worship, and was 
smitten by the Divine judgment; the Word of 
God grew and multiplied. 

The new departure at Antioch, the begin- 
ning of which was chronicled in the previous 
section, now became operative. Paul, the new 
instrument, was commissioned by the action of 
the church at Antioch in co-operation with the 
Spirit of God; and there follows an account 
of his first labours. Sent out from Antioch, 
he visited Cyprus, and then from Paphos 
passed through Perga to Antioch in Pisidia; 
and on through Iconium and Lystra, to Derbe. 
Turning back through Lystra, Iconium, An- 
tioch in Pisidia, and Perga, he called at At- 
talia, and reached Antioch. It is the story of 
a prevailing ministry accompanied by perse- 
cution. 

The account of the first Christian council 
follows. It opened with much desultory dis- 
cussion, after which t^vo serious contributions 
resulted in final decision. In connection with 
this council Peter makes his last appearance 
in the record, in a weighty utterance in de- 
fence of Gentile inclusion. James pronounced 
judgment, and with remarkable unanimity, 
action was taken in the interest of this larger 
work. The separation between Barnabas and 
Paul is an interesting revelation of the im- 



88 Acts 

perfection of the best men. Paul found a new 
companion in Timothy, and they journeyed to- 
gether visiting the churches. 

The beginning of the second missionary 
journey was noted for an almost startling ex- 
perience. The Spirit hurried Paul onward 
against his inclination. Arrived at the coast, 
the vision of the man of Macedonia explained 
that strange constraint of the Spirit, and in 
answer to that vision the apostle's European 
ministry commenced. At Philippi, which was 
a Roman colony, he found himself nearer than 
ever to the centre of earthly government. The 
story of the progress through Philippi, Thessa- 
lonica, Bergea, Athens, to Corinth, is one of 
continued triumph, notwithstanding diffi- 
culty. In each case testimony was borne, and 
results followed, and all the while the sense 
of responsibility and of resource was the in- 
spiration of continuity in service and patience 
in suffering. 

Turning back into Asia, w^e have in brief 
compass the chronicle of what in those days 
must have been long journeys. Proceeding 
from Corinth to Ephesus, on to Csesarea, to 
Jerusalem, where he stayed long enough to 
salute the church, Paul returned to Antioch, 
and the second missionary journey ended. 
From here we see him starting upon his third 



The Church Formed and Witnessing 89 

journey, passing first over the old ground, re- 
visiting the newly formed churches, strength- 
ening believers in their faith. 

During Paul's absence, Apollos, a Jew by 
birth, yet trained in all Greek thought, exer- 
cised a ministry which was at first limited 
by the fact that his knowledge of Jesus was 
only that obtained through the ministry of 
John. More accurately instructed by Pris- 
cilla and Aquila, he passed into Achaia, and 
making Corinth his centre of operations, did 
much to strengthen the believers. 

The story of the return of Paul to Ephesus 
is full of interest. He first led into the fuller 
light the band of men who had been influenced 
by the ministry of Apollos, and for three 
months he preached in the synagogue. Then, 
because of the opposition raised against him, 
he secured the school of Tyrannus, where he 
exercised his ministry for two years with 
wonderful effect. A new opposition mani- 
fested itself at length, stirred up by those 
whose craft was in danger, and resulting in 
actual riot. 

This was followed by a return to Europe, 
and a three months' stay in Greece, of which 
there is practically no account given. Paul 
then set out upon his last long journey 
through Jerusalem toward Rome. At Troas 



90 Acts 

the account of his converse with the saints is 
a wonderful revelation of his enthusiasm for 
Christ. There is a great restlessness manifest 
in his attitude, which undoubtedly is to be 
explained by the declaration made in the 
previous section, "I must also see Rome." As 
we follow Paul from Troas to Miletus, from 
Miletus to Tyre, from Tyre to Jerusalem, we 
find him calm and confident, his face set to- 
ward Jerusalem, while yet his spirit was evi- 
dently urging him toward Rome. 

Arrived at Jerusalem the apostle was re- 
ceived by the elders, and at once rehearsed the 
story of the w^onderful triumphs of the Word 
among the Gentiles. A strong spirit of op- 
position to his work manifested itself among 
the Jewish section of the Christians. In order 
to pacify this section Paul consented for a 
moment to a policy of compromise in the mat- 
ter of the men with a vow. Disturbance fol- 
lowed which led to his ill treatment, and sub- 
sequent arrest by the Roman captain. In his 
great defence before the multitudes the last 
word he was permitted to utter was the word 
"Gentiles." Immediately the whole fury of 
the crowds broke out, and they clamoured for 
his blood. Thus in a moment of crisis, in 
loyalty to the call of Christ which came so 
long ago in the Temple vision, he broke for 



The Church Formed and Witnessing 91 

ever with all the trammels of that system; 
and from thenceforth to the end, through suf- 
fering and through bonds, he fulfilled his high 
calling as the apostle of freedom, as messenger 
of that Christ in Whom there is neither Jew 
nor Greek. 

The resourcefulness of Paul is evidenced 
in his attitude in the midst of these trying cir- 
cumstances. His appeal as a Roman citizen 
was the climax of a remarkable threefold 
method. He spoke in the Greek tongue, and 
so obtained the opportunity of speech; he ad 
dressed the Jews in the Hebrew tongue, and 
so gained their attention; and now claimed 
the privileges of Roman citizenship. Yet the 
strain upon him was great, and in this con- 
nection is manifest the graciousness of the 
midnight vision, when the Lord stood by him, 
and in words which must have been as sweet- 
est music to the heart of His troubled servant 
said to him, ^'Be of good cheer"; and by a 
new commission "so must thou bear witness 
also at Rome," sealed his own wish, "I must 
also see Rome." A conspiracy was hatched to 
encompass his death, but he was rescued. Be- 
fore Felix, Paul uttered a defence which af- 
fords a splendid illustration of the strength 
and dignity of one who was conscious that he 
had nothing to hide, and nothing to gain by 



92 Acts 

concealment and distortion of truth. His ad- 
dress was courageous, courteous, and clear. 
His defence before Agrippa, while eloquent in 
defence of his own cause, was yet directed to- 
ward an attempt to capture the king^s con- 
science and constrain it toward Christ. 

The account of the last recorded voyage of 
the apostle is full of interest. It would seem 
as though all the forces were combined in an 
effort to prevent his coming to the city on the 
seven hills. At last he arrived, and a great 
day dawned for the Gentile world. In loyalty 
to his brethren after the flesh, notwithstand- 
ing all the opposition they had offered to him 
in Asia, and the bitterness of the persecution 
that followed him to Jerusalem, in Rome also 
he delivered his first message to them. Here 
also, however, he was compelled to turn from 
them to the Gentiles, and the last picture we 
have of him is that of his dwelling in his own 
hired house, receiving all who came to him, 
preaching the Kingdom of God, and teaching 
the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ. 

Thus ends the story of the first things in 
the history of the Church. The book is evi- 
dently a fragment. From the centre, Christ, 
the lines are seen proceeding in every direc- 
tion, but the uttermost part of the earth is not 
reached.

ROMANS 

OF the founding of the church at Rome we 
have no authentic details. The hypothe- 
ses are, that it was one of the earliest 
churches; that it was founded by "sojourners 
from Rome" who were present on the day of 
Pentecost and carried the evangel to the im- 
perial city, and thus the church was planted; 
that Paul wrote this letter in Corinth during 
his three months' stays there after the uproar 
in Ephesus; and that Phoebe's approaching 
visit to Rome (xvi. 1, 2) offered him the 
opportunity of sending it to the church 
there. 

This letter is the foundation document of 
the Pauline system of teaching. It is in- 
tended to set forth clearly God's way of sal- 
vation for ruined man. The argument falls 
into two main parts, the first dealing with the 
Gospel unto Salvation (i. 16-xi.) ; the second 
dealing with the Transformation by Salvation 
(xii.-xv. 13). These are preceded by an In- 
troduction (i. 1-15), and followed by a Con- 
clusion (xv. 14-xvi.).

96 Romans 



Introduction 

The writer introduced himself as an apostle 
of Jesus, and greeted his readers as "beloved 
of God, called saints." He then declared his 
personal interest in them, telling them how 
he thanked God for them, made mention of 
them in his prayers, and longed to see them. 
Pre-eminently conscious of how strategic a 
point for the Kingdom of God Rome was, he 
earnestly desired to see them that he might 
impart "some spiritual gift." As that was 
impossible, he wrote this letter. In this con- 
nection he wrote those ever-memorable and 
illuminative words which declared him to be a 
debtor, and ready to discharge his debt. 

A. The Gospel unto Salvation 

This first division of the letter opens with 
a fundamental affirmation, and then proceeds 
to discuss, the condemnation which made the 
Gospel necessary; the salvation, of which the 
Gospel was the message; and finally, certain 
objections likely to be raised in the minds of 
the Hebrew readers. 

The fundamental affirmation declares the 
gospel to be one of power, that is, equal to 
accomplishment, and therefore infinitely more 
than the presentation of an ideal, or the enun- 



Christ the Salvation of God 97 

ciation of an ethic. The one condition upon 
which this poAver hecomes operative is indi- 
cated in the phrase, "to every one that be- 
lieveth." The nature of the provision which 
the Gospel announces is that of righteousness 
at the disposal of unrighteous men. 

In dealing with the condemnation which 
made the Gospel necessary the apostle com- 
menced with the Gentiles. After announcing 
the general principle that "the wrath of God 
is revealed . . . against ungodliness and un- 
righteousness," he proceeded to declare the 
measure of Gentile knowledge to be that of the 
revelation of the poAver and Divinity of God 
through created things. Their sin consisted 
in the fact of "holding down the truth in un- 
righteousness," in that they deified that which 
revealed, instead of worshipping the One re- 
vealed. Their judgment consisted in their be- 
ing abandoned to their own sin of refusing to 
act upon the measure of light received. 

The Jew is next described as one who con- 
demned Gentile sins under the impression that 
the possession of the law ensured some kind 
of benefit to him. All such confidence is 
swept aside as the Jew is charged with prac- 
tising the evils w^hich he condemns. The fail- 
ure of the Jews is then stated in greater de- 
tail. They did actually possess in the law the 



98 Romans 



form of knowledge and truth. By a series of 
questions the apostle inferentially charged 
them with actual failure in conduct, and so 
with the sin of blaspheming the name of God 
among the Gentiles; finally declaring that a 
Jew who is merely one outwardly, is not a 
Jew. He then turned to a brief discussion of 
certain objections which would almost inevi- 
tably be raised. First, "What advantage then 
hath the Jew?'' to which he replied, "Much 
every way," and then spoke of one — that they 
were entrusted with the oracles of God. To 
the inquiry, if faith failed on the part of man 
would God be unfaithful, he replied that it is 
impossible for God to be unfaithful, but 
showed that His faithfulness is to His own 
character; and that if a man sin. He judges 
him; if he repent, He forgives him. 

He then includes both Jew and Gentile, and 
utters an appalling verdict concerning the 
whole race in the quotation of a series of pas- 
sages from the Old Testament. The whole 
world is guilty. 

In dealing with the Gospel message the first 
subject is that of justification. The scheme 
is first summarized. To the condemned race 
"a righteousness of God hath been mani- 
fested," which is at their disposal. It is wit- 
nessed by the law and the prophets. It is ap- 



Christ the Salvation of God 99 

propriated by the faith of any, "for there is 
no distinction." In the development of the 
theme the apostle dealt more explicitly with 
the consequent facts, namely that the right- 
eousness of God is at the disposal of those who 
believe. The charge against the race is re- 
peated, "All have sinned." Immediately the 
provision of grace is announced. That provi- 
sion operates through the medium of redemp- 
tion, accomplished by Christ Jesus, through 
propitiation in His blood. Thus the work of 
the Cross is set at the heart of this evangel of 
salvation, and is seen to be a fulfilment of 
God's purpose, by God's Son, for the vindica- 
tion of God's righteousness, in the action of 
God's forbearance. The condition of human 
appropriation is that of faith in Jesus. This 
evangel is founded upon eternal justice. Jus- 
tification is the act of God, through Christ, 
in response to faith. The apostle declared 
that this method of imputed righteousness in 
response to faith was in harmony with the 
whole history of Israel. This he illustrated 
at length from the history of Abraham. 

The values or privileges of justification are 
dealt with under two heads, those experienced 
by the individual believer, and those at the 
disposal of the race. The privileges of the in- 
dividual believer are intimately connected 



1 00 Romans 



with the essential things of God, grace and 
glory, which Christ came to reveal. They 
carry a twofold responsibility ; that of a peace 
with God, which means the end of controversy, 
and that of rejoicing, which is based upon the 
certainty of His ultimate victory. The effect 
of this new relationship to God is that all life 
is changed, and even tribulation becomes the 
minister of progress. The values of justifica- 
tion, as at the disposal of the race, are set 
forth by a contrast between the first and last 
Adam. As far as the evil results of the first 
Adam's sin have spread, so far do the benefits 
of the last Adam's work extend. By faith in 
the last Adam, man can be set free from the 
effects of the disobedience of the first Adam. 
By continuity in the disobedience of the sins 
of the first Adam, man is excluded from the 
values of the work of the last Adam. 

Sanctification is the experimental appro- 
priation of the virtue, as well as the value, of 
the work of Christ. In the last section the 
opposing principles of action were seen to be, 
faith in Jesus, and continuity in sin. The 
question is now^ asked. Can these both govern 
life? This is answered by insistence upon the 
fact of the believer's identification with Christ 
in death, and in life, and the responsibilities 
of such identification. The negative responsi- 



Christ the Salvation of God 101 

bility is declared first, "even so reckon.'^ Sin 
is not to reign in the mortal body. The mas- 
tery of the life by the desires of the flesh is no 
longer necessary, by reason of the new life 
possessed in Christ. The positive responsibil- 
ity is that of presenting ourselves as "alive 
from the dead." This new obligation resting 
upon the believer is then illustrated by the 
figures of the bond-slave, and marriage. The 
servant of sin is the slave of sin. The servant 
of righteousness is the bond-servant of right- 
eousness. The believer is freed from the cov- 
enant of law by death, and brought into new 
covenant with Christ by life. The death 
w^hich frees him, is the death of Christ; the 
life which enables him, is the life of Christ. 
A change of masters will produce a change of 
service, and a change of covenant changes the 
centre of responsibility. 

This argument is then illustrated by one of 
the great personal and experimental passages 
of the Pauline writings. The pronouns 
change from the plural to the singular. The 
apostle gives a picture of his religious experi- 
ence up to the time of his meeting with Christ ; 
his condition before law, his experience at the 
coming of law, and his subsequent experience 
under law^; all of which prepares the w^ay for 
the description of the new experience of such 



102 Romans 



as are not under law but under grace. From 
the fearful sense of condemnation they pass 
into the consciousness of no condemnation. 
From the slavery of the law of sin and death 
they emerge into the law of the spirit of free- 
dom and life. Then follows a detailed con- 
trast between life in the flesh, and life in the 
spirit. 

Glorification is dealt with by an onward 
look from the midst of that suffering to which 
Paul had already referred. The apostle first 
suggested, and then declined, a comparison 
between the sufferings and the glory. In the 
light of the accomplished redemption, the 
apostle sees all things working together, even 
through processes of pain which express them- 
selves in groaning, toward the ultimate good. 
That pain of Nature is the consciousness of 
the saint, but finally and supremely that of 
God Himself. This assurance issues in the 
triumphant challenge of the believing soul to 
all the forces which can possibly be against it ; 
and the unfolding of God's plan of salvation 
ends with the cry of an assured triumph. 

The certainty of no separation creates the 
sorrow of fellowship with Christ in the pres- 
ence of the need of man. Its first expression, 
in the case of the apostle, was toward his 
brethren after the flesh. After an enuncia- 



Christ the Salvation of God 103 

tion of glorious facts concerning Israel, fac- 
ing their present condition, he was conscious 
that it appeared as though the Word of God 
had come to nought. This was not so, because 
the promises made were not to a people after 
the flesh. The purpose of election was char- 
acter, and its principle was the mercy and 
compassion of God. God exercises that mercy 
toward those who believe. The apostle then 
selected an illustration from the opposite con- 
dition, that namely of the wilful hardening of 
the heart against God, and shows how God 
finally hardened the man who had persistently 
hardened himself. The sovereignty of elec- 
tion was then insisted upon by the use of the 
ancient figure of the potter; and finally the 
declaration was made that the Gentiles are 
chosen to become a people of God, because 
they attain righteousness by faith, while Is- 
rael failed as a nation, through seeking to es- 
tablish righteousness apart from faith. Thus 
the choice of God is of such as believe. The 
test is the Son of His love. 

Again declaring his affection for his own 
people, and his desire for their salvation, the 
apostle proceeded to discuss the way of return. 
Israel had been rejected because of her rebel- 
lion, in spite of the fact that the hands of God 
had been spread out continuously toward her. 



104 Romans 



The original purpose of God, however, is re- 
tained. A temporary casting off of the nation 
after the flesh, and the bringing in of the Gen- 
tiles is in itself a movement toward the ulti- 
mate fulfilment of the original Divine inten- 
tion. He then solemnly warned the Gentile 
Christians that if God spared not natural 
branches, neither will He spare those grafted 
in, save upon the one condition of belief. Un- 
believing Israel had been rejected as a nation, 
in order that the outside world which they 
failed to bless might receive salvation. 
Through the accomplishment of that larger 
purpose, blessing would return to Israel. The 
doxology which follows forms the conclusion 
of the whole doctrinal statement of the epistle. 

B. Transformation. By Salvation 

The second division of the letter opens with 
an inclusive final appeal, which the apostle 
proceeds to apply in a description of the trans- 
formed life, in its simplicity, submission, and 
sympathy. 

The word "therefore'' links all that is now 
to be said with everything that has already 
been said. Because of the grace of God the 
believer is called to certain attitudes and ac- 
tions. The first of these is that of personal 
abandonment to God. Man, essentially a 



Christ the Salvation of God 105 

spirit, is to make his own body the sacrificial 
symbol of his worship. The spirit is evidently 
God's ; the body is therefore presented to God ; 
the mind is thus renewed according to the 
will of God. 

One of the first and positive proofs of aban- 
donment to the will of God is the character of 
humility. The test of humility is the con- 
sciousness of communion. To illustrate thia 
the apostle uses the figure of the body, wherein 
the importance of each member is measured 
by its contribution to the whole. A list of 
gifts, bestowed as within the one body of 
Christ, is then given. The character of humil- 
ity finally expresses itself in the conduct of 
simplicity. Love is to be without hypocrisy; 
that is, without acting; that is, simple. 

Submission to authority was specially neces- 
sary for Christians living in Rome at the time 
of the writing of this letter. Yet the apostle 
so stated it as to leave clearly in view the 
abiding principles rather than the local col- 
ouring. The first law in the life of the Chris- 
tian is his abandonment to the will of God. 
When earthly authority is exercised in har- 
mony therewith, obedience is enjoined. Neces- 
sarily, therefore, when authority comes into 
conflict with Divine laws the Christian must 
refuse to obey, even at the cost of suffering. 



106 Romans 



Abandonment to the will of God is evidenced, 
moreover, before the world at large by the dis- 
charge of all just debts. The incentive to 
realization of the surrendered life is that the 
children of the Lord are to walk as in the day, 
even though the night is round about them. 

The final expression of the surrendered life 
is that of sympathy, which is first dealt with 
as toleration. This is illustrated by a discus- 
sion of the matter of diet, and the matter of 
days; and he insists upon the fact that there 
is but one throne of judgment, and that there- 
fore we have no right to usurp the function in 
relation to our brethren. Sympathy, however, 
is more than toleration, it is edification. 
Therefore the highest principle of freedom is 
abandonment of a right, if need be, for the 
good of a weak brother. The one final test, 
and perhaps the severest test of conduct pos- 
sible, is enunciated in the words, "whatsoever 
is not of faith is sin." Yet once more, sym- 
pathy is also hospitality. This is inculcated 
in the injunction, "Receive ye one another." 
The most powerful line of argument for this 
conduct is that of the example of Christ. 

Conclusion 

The epistle being ended as to its statement 
of doctrine, and the application thereof to life, 



Christ the Salvation of God 107 

the apostle turned to personal matters. In 
the course of this conclusion incidental reve- 
lations of his methods and ideals of Christian 
service occur which are very valuable. Touch- 
ing and beautiful is his request for the prayers 
of those to whom he wrote. The section of 
salutation is full of interest. Twenty-six dif- 
ferent persons are named. Two-thirds of the 
names are Greek, and in all probability are 
names of persons Paul had actually known in 
his work in Asia. Throughout these saluta- 
tions there is manifest the apostle's banscious- 
ness of the inter-relationship of the saints as 
being dependent upon their common relation- 
ship to Christ. It is this very consciousness 
of unity that caused the solemn note of warn- 
ing as he referred to certain false teachers. 
Once more he turned to salutations, but this 
time from those associated with him at Cor- 
inth. 

The epistle closes with a doxology, in which 
the apostle refers to that perpetual purpose 
of love, which, having been kept in silence 
through ages, had now been manifested in this 
evangel, in order that through all the coming 
ages there might rise the song of glory to God ; 
and he reverently ascribed the glory to Whom 
it was thus evidently due.

I CORINTHIANS 

THE history of the founding of the Co- 
rinthian church is found in Acts xviii. 
In the days of the apostle Corinth had 
become the virtual capital of Greece. It was 
famous for its wealth, magnificence, and cul- 
ture. ^To live as they do at Corinth" was an 
expression of the time, which suggested condi- 
tions of luxury and licentiousness, for the city 
was a veritable hotbed of all kinds of im- 
purity. 

The church existing in the midst of this 
most appalling corruption was influenced by 
it in more ways than one, and this letter was 
immediately addressed to the correcting of the 
disorder arising from this influence. It has 
been called the epistle of New Testament 
Church order. While that is perfectly true, 
it describes rather that which is incidental 
than that which is fundamental. It is a 
treatise dealing with Church order, but al- 
ways in view of the fact that the Church is an 
instrument for the accomplishment of a cer- 
tain purpose; and pre-eminently, therefore, it 
is the epistle which deals with the fitness of 
111 



112 I Corinthians 

the Church for fellowship with Jesus Christ 
in His work. 

After a general Introduction (i. 1-8) the 
epistle falls into two main parts. The first 
is Corrective, and deals with the Carnalities 
( i. 9-xi. ) ; the second is Constructive, and 
deals with the Spiritualities (xii.-xv.). It 
ends with an illustrative Conclusion (xvi.)« 

Introduction 

In his introduction, after referring to him- 
self as "an apostle . . . through the will of 
God," and associating Sosthenes with what he 
was about to write, Paul prepared the way by 
addressing the Church, describing it as to its 
character, "sanctified in Christ Jesus, called 
saints'^ ; and as to its equipment, "enriched in 
Him.'^ 

A. Corrective. The Carnalities 

In this division the first thing is the state- 
ment of a fundamental proposition, in which 
the apostle declared that the Church was 
called into the fellowship of Jesus Christ the 
Lord, and affirmed the faithfulness of God to 
such fellowship. 

From that point he proceeded to deal with 
the manifestations of the dominance of the 
carnal nature in the Corinthian Church, 



The Medium of Work 113 

which proved that thej were not living as 
saints, and therefore were not fulfilling the 
responsibilities of fellowship. 

The first subject dealt with js that of the 
divisions which had arisen among them. The 
key to the understanding of these divisions is 
found in the phrase, "the wisdom of words.'' 
Each teacher, whether Paul, or Apollos, or 
Cephas, had laid emphasis on some distinctive 
phase of truth. The Corinthians had grouped 
themselves into parties around these em- 
phases. A corrective for such schism would 
be found in an understanding of ''the Word of 
the Cross." Then followed a contrast at 
length of the wisdom of the age, as manifested 
in "the wisdom of words," with the wisdom of 
God, as revealed in "the Word of the Cross." 
Reminding them of his own method when he 
first came to them, he was careful to declare 
that the Word of the Cross was indeed one of 
surpassing wisdom, dealing with the deep 
things of God, and the natural man could not 
receive it. 

He then proceeded to show the real meaning 
of these divisions. They arose out of the car- 
nality of the Corinthian Christians. This 
carnality had expressed itself in their par- 
tiality for certain teachers, and therefore the 
apostle was careful to teach the subservience 



114 I Corinthians 

and sublimity of the work of the ministry. 
The subservience is manifest in the fact that 
all contribute to the final result upon which 
the heart of God is set. The sublimity is 
evidenced in the fact that all co-operate with 
God. Elaborating the figure of the Church 
as the building of God, he declared that all 
exercising the ministry of the Word were 
building upon the foundation of Jesus Christ, 
and that the value of their work would ulti- 
mately be tested by Him. The point of the 
argument is that the supreme matter is the 
building, and the builders are subservient. 
Continuing, he rose on to a yet higher level 
as he declared the purpose of the building — 
"ye are a sanctuary of God." "The Spirit 
of God dwelleth in you.'' In the light of this 
almost overwhelming statement the apostle 
wrote the most searching and solemn warning 
against the destruction of the temple. Sum- 
marizing his argument that the wisdom of the 
age is foolishness with God, he proceeded to 
show that all things belong to such as receive 
the revelation; both the teachers, and all the 
facts and forces which touch personality and 
affect it. Returning to the subject of the 
Christian teachers, the apostle defined their 
responsibility as being "ministers of Christ," 
and their work as that of "stewards of the 



The Medium of Work 115 

. ^ — — 

mysteries of God." Such a conviction pro- 
duced independence of the judgment of men, 
and remitted everything to the final test of 
the Lord Himself. Then followed a passage 
laden with scorn for the folly of the Corin- 
thian Christians, and characterized by keen 
satire. It would seem, however, as though 
this faithful steward of the mysteries of God 
feared lest the impetuous sweep of his anger 
should be misunderstood, and he hastened to 
close the section in words full of tenderness. 
The apostle now passed to other evidences of 
the carnality of the Church. The first was 
that of a lack of discipline. A case of im- 
morality utterly bad, judged even by the low 
standards of morality current in Corinth 
among the Gentiles, had brought no sense of 
shame to the Church, and consequently no 
action had been taken in the matter. The 
Church w^as called to immediate and drastic 
dealing therewith, in order first to the ulti- 
mate salvation of the excommunicated man; 
and secondly, to the purification of the 
Church, which would suffer in its corporate 
capacity through the toleration within its 
borders of the leaven of evil. From the par- 
ticular illustration he deduced the general 
principles upon which the Church must ever 
act in the presence of evil within her borders. 



116 I Corinthians 

The wicked man must be put away from the 
company of the saints. 

The next dereliction dealt with was that of 
the submission of disputes to heathen tribu- 
nals by members of the Church. The teach- 
ing is clear and remarkable, and has an appli- 
cation for all time. Disputes among saints 
should be settled between saints, and wholly 
within the confines of the Church. This de- 
cision he based, first, upon the fitness of the 
saints for judging such things; and secondly, 
upon the unfitness of unbelievers for the same 
work. 

The last dereliction may be described as 
desecration of the temple of God by impurity 
of personal life. The apostle laid down prin- 
ciples revealing the limitations of Christian 
liberty, and declaring that the believer joined 
to the Lord "is one Spirit" ; and affirmed there- 
fore that all the functions and powers of the 
life must be dominated by that Spirit. Such 
a statement revealed, as in a flash, the awful 
heinousness of all such sin. 

The last section of the corrective division 
arose out of difficulties which had arisen in the 
Church concerning which they had sent in- 
quiries to the apostle. Very much of this is 
necessarily local. His answers, however, con- 
tained principles of permanent application. 



The Medium of Work 117 

CoDcerning marriage the principles enun- 
ciated were, that marriage is in itself honour- 
able and right, that when the marriage union 
exists between converted and unconverted men 
and women the believer is not to take the in- 
itiative in bringing about a dissolution. If, 
on the other hand, the unbeliever is the acting 
person, no blame attaches to the Christian. 
The all-governing fact in the life of the Chris- 
tian is that he is the Lord's bond-servant, and 
must so act as in loyalty to, and fellowship 
with. Him. The daughters of the King are to 
settle the question of marriage always and 
only within this sphere, consenting or refusing 
according as such action will help or hinder 
their highest realization of the fulfilment of 
His purposes. 

The next dififtculty had to do with things 
sacrificed to idols, and from the discussion of 
the local circumstances we may deduce a prin- 
ciple of permanent application. Love de- 
mands the consideration of the weakness of 
others. In the course of the argument he con- 
trasted knowledge and love: "Knowledge 
pufi'eth up," "love edifieth"; and showed that 
the Christian desire must be to edify, and 
therefore that love rather than knowledge is 
to be the true principle of action. The apostle 
illustrated the principle by his own action in 



118 I Corinthians 

another matter. He claimed the right to 
cease working for his own living, and to look 
to them for material support. He declared 
that, while he had that right, he did not exer- 
cise it. This illustration carries out the true 
value of the first principle laid down. His 
knowledge of right would have puffed him up. 
Love resulted in their building up. The same 
principles he then enforced by illustrations 
from the religious and athletic feasts. The 
one master principle obtaining in the mind 
of those who ran in the races he expressed in 
these words: "So run that ye may obtain." 
The goal of the Christian is not merely his 
own crowning, but the ultimate realization by 
all, of the purposes of the Lord; so that the 
question whether things sacrificed to idols 
must be eaten, must be decided in the light of 
the necessity for bringing all present matters 
into subservience to that final issue of the 
goal. 

Continuing to deal with the same subject, 
he persistently set it in the light of such prin- 
ciples as cover the whole field of life, and illus- 
trated the fact that privilege is not in itself 
assurance against ultimate failure by refer- 
ence to the example of Israel. They were 
guilty of four sins; idolatry, fornication, 
tempting Jehovah, and murmuring. Because 



The Medium of Work 119 

of these, notwithstanding their baptism to 
Moses, their eating of spiritual food, and 
drinking spiritual drink, they were over- 
thrown. The warning based upon the illus- 
tration is contained in the words, "Wherefore 
let him that thinketh he standeth take heed 
lest he fall." To this warning he added the 
gracious declaration, "God . . . will . . . make 
also a way of escape. . . . Wherefore, my be- 
loved, flee from idolatry." Then, in sudden 
and startling fashion, he gave the greatest 
argument for the Christian position by put- 
ting the Christian feasts into contrast with 
idol feasts. The position is summarized in 
the teaching that the test of Christian action 
is expediency, and the test of expediency is edi- 
fication. This summary is followed by local 
instructions, and finally the whole teaching is 
condensed into the form of two governing 
principles, first, "Do all to the glory of God" ; 
and second, "Give no occasion of stumbling." 
Dealing with the question of the position of 
women in the Corinthian assembly, he taught 
that woman bears the relation to man that 
man bears to Christ. Man bears the same re- 
lation to Christ as that which Christ bears to 
God. If we commence this argument from the 
highest fact, the relation of Christ to God, 
three great facts are borne in upon the mind. 



120 I Corinthians 

God is equal with Christ, God co-operates 
with Christ, God is the Head of Christ. Car- 
rying this out, we see that Christ has made 
Himself equal with man for co-operation with 
man, while yet He is the Head of man. Again 
following the argument, man is equal with the 
woman in Christ, for co-operation with her 
in Christ, while he is yet her head in Christ. 
The application of the principle is that woman 
has a right to the exercise of ministry, but 
that in such exercise she must ever recognize 
the headship of man. Knowing that this 
might be misconstrued into an argument for 
the inferiority of woman, which would lead 
to their being despised in Corinth, he declared 
that in the Lord neither is without the other. 
Both are needed for the fulfilment of His pur- 
poses. 

The last matter discussed at length in this 
section was that of the Lord's Supper. In 
their observance of this sacred ordinance, 
which was intended to be the symbol of com- 
munion, they had manifested differences and 
divisions. The condition of affairs existing 
is a startling revelation of the carnality of the 
Church. In order to the correction of these 
abuses he first told them the simple story of 
the institution of the sacred feast, and then de- 
clared its value to the world, and in solemn 



The Medium of Work 121 

words warned them against the condemnation 
consequent upon unworthy eating and drink- 
ing. Thus closed the distinctively corrective 
section of the letter. There were other mat- 
ters needing attention, but these the apostle 
dismissed in the words, "The rest will I set in 
order when I come." 

B. Constructive. The Spiritualities 

Turning from the corrective section of his 
letter, to the constructive, the apostle devoted 
himself to dealing with the spiritualities, 
which conditioned the order of the Church, 
and equipped her for her service, under three 
heads ; the unifying Spirit, the unfailing Law, 
the ultimate Triumph. 

In setting forth the great truth of the unifi- 
cation of the Church by the Spirit of God the 
apostle first showed how the union was 
created. The master principle is that of the 
Lordship of Jesus, and the power both for con- 
fession and obedience is that of the Holy 
Spirit. In the administration of the unifica- 
tion, the unifying force is God in the three 
Persons of His Trinity. Within the unity 
there is variety of gifts, ministries, workings. 
The whole truth may be summarized thus ; the 
Spirit bestows the gifts or capacities; the 
Lord directs the service; God bestows the 



122 I Corinthians 

power. This threefold fact the apostle then 
dealt with in greater detail. The diversities 
of gifts by the Spirit is set forth in the enumer- 
ation of nine separate and distinct gifts, all of 
which are bestowed by and under the control 
of the one Spirit. The ministrations of the 
Lord are illustrated under the figure of the 
body, wherein diversity is recognized as the 
consent of all members to the government of 
the Head, that government creating the prin- 
ciple of power and unification. The subject 
of the workings of God is introduced by a 
fundamental statement, "God hath set," and 
then an illustrative list of eight manifesta- 
tions of ability follow. 

The teaching concerning the unifying Spirit 
ended with the injunction to desire earnestly 
the best gifts, and the promise that the apostle 
would show the most excellent way to obtain 
them. That he now proceeded to do by deal- 
ing with the unfailing law. That law briefly 
is love, and in the chapter which is so full of 
beauty we have his analysis of love. He set 
forth first its values, showing it to be the 
strength of service, the energy of equipment, 
the dynamic of devotion; and then named its 
virtues in a double seven ; finally declaring its 
absolute victory in the all-inclusive declara- 
tion "love never faileth," which declaration he 



The Medium of Work 123 

demonstrated by comparison between the 
things that pass and the things that abide, of 
which latter he declared love to be the 
greatest. 

Having thus dealt with the law, he pro- 
ceeded to show how it operates, returning to 
the subject of gifts. The whole teaching here 
may thus be stated; the desire for the best 
gift is to be tested by the profitableness of the 
gift in the edification of another, and thus 
finally the inspiration of true desire is love. 

Finally the apostle turned to the discussion 
of the ultimate triumph, setting in its light all 
the difficulties and disorders of the little 
while. Dealing first with Christ^s resurrec- 
tion, he claimed that it was established by 
three lines of proof: his preaching, and the 
results following in their own experience ; that 
the resurrection was in harmony with the 
declarations of Scripture; that it was attested 
by a company of those who actually saw Him 
after resurrection. He then set forth the im- 
portance of the doctrine of resurrection in re- 
gard to the salvation and the resurrection of 
the saints, in regard to the programme of God, 
and in its bearing on present conduct. Turn- 
ing to the discussion of intellectual difficul- 
ties, he practically summarized them in two 
questions : "How are the dead raised up?" and 



124 I Corinthians 

"With what body do thej come?" Dealing 
with mistaken ideas concerning the doctrine 
of resurrection, he claimed that death was in 
itself a process of resurrection, and that there 
might be continuity of personality without 
identity of the material body, but insisting 
that the new body would come in some sense 
out of the old. All through he used the illus- 
tration of the single grain of seed. In answer 
to the second question, "With what body do 
they come?" he described, in a wonderful pas- 
sage, the new body as being soul-governed. 
Finally he uttered anew his assurance of the 
fact of resurrection^ and ended the whole 
argument with a magnificent challenge to 
death which breathes the spirit of triumph 
over it. 

He then made his ultimate appeal, which 
must be read in close connection with the fun- 
damental proposition. Having shown the 
perils of the carnalities, and corrected them 
by a declaration concerning the spiritualities, 
he laid upon the saints to whom he wTote the 
solemn charge that they should be "stedfast, 
unmovable, always abounding" in that fellow- 
ship into which they had been placed in the 
"work of the Lord." 



The Medium of Work 125 

Illustrative Conclusion 

The conclusion is local and personal, yet 
nevertheless is an interesting commentary 
upon the theme of the whole letter. The idea 
of fellowship in service obtains from first to 
last, as to the collection for the troubled saints 
at Jerusalem, as to the apostle's own manifold 
activities, as to Timothy, and Apollos, and 
other loved ones who help in the work and 
labour ; until at last the Lord in Whose work 
all are engaged is declared; and those who 
love Him not are pronounced Anathema. The 
final word is that of the grace of the Lord as 
a message of blessing to Corinth, and in that 
the apostle has fellowship also, in that he 
sends to them his love in Christ Jesus.

II CORINTHIANS 

THE second letter to the Corinthians was 
evidently the outcome of the first. 
Titus, and perhaps Timothy also, had com- 
municated to the apostle certain facts concern- 
ing the reception of his first letter. There 
were in Corinth those who imputed wrong 
motives to him, denied the suf&ciency of his 
apostolic credentials, and practically refused 
to believe in him. In this letter the apostle 
answered these people, vindicating his claim 
and his conduct. In doing this he remarkably 
revealed his heart, and declared how high and 
holy was his conception of the office of the 
ministry. 

If the first epistle was that of the Church 
prepared for work by corrective and construc- 
tive statements, this may be said to be a pic- 
ture of the apostle himself as a worker, in suf- 
fering, in love, and in the consciousness of the 
authority conferred upon him by God. 

The letter does not easily lend itself to an- 
alysis, but may be divided by the principal 
subjects dealt with. Introduction (i. 1-11), 
the Principles of the Ministry, an Answer to

Saints, an Exhortation (viii., ix.) ; the Visit

Introduction 

After the salutation, the apostle, before 
dealing with the matters calling forth the let- 
ter, wrote of a great trouble through which he 
had passed, and expressed his joy in the com- 
fort that had come to him, principally on ac- 
count of the ability to comfort others arising 
therefrom. He had passed through some af- 
fliction in Asia, in all probability a sickness in 
which he had come nigh unto death. He recog- 
nized the aid afforded him by their prayers, 
speaking of his deliverance as a gift bestowed 
upon him by them. Thus appealing to their 
love and sympathy, he prepared them for 
much he was about to write in defence of him- 
self against the misinterpretation of some in 
Corinth. 

A. The Ministry 

The attitude of those in Corinth who were 
hostile to him arose out of their misconception 
of the true vocation of the Christian minister ; 
and in this first division of the letter he wrote 
first in personal vindication, then in instruc- 



A Sequel 131 



tion concerning the ministry, and finally in 
appeal to them. 

He began by reminding them inferentially 
that he did not purpose according to the flesh, 
but rather under Divine guidance realized 
through the Lordship of Jesus, and inter- 
preted by the Spirit. 

He then explained the action which they 
had criticised, that namely of his not having 
come to Corinth, according to his declared 
purpose. He had remained away, out of love 
for them, that he might spare them, and to this 
assertion he called God to witness. His sor- 
row over their sin was such that to have come 
would have been to have done so in sorrow, 
and thus would have brought sorrow to them. 
He had therefore written, that the cause of the 
sorrow might be removed. Having thus re- 
ferred to his first letter, the apostle returned 
to the subject of the incestuous person with 
which he had dealt therein. Evidently they 
had followed out his instruction, and dealt in 
discipline with the wrong-doer ; and the effect 
had been salutary in his case. He now urged 
them to the duty of manifesting their love, by 
restoring this one to their fellowship. He 
urged this action, "that no advantage may be 
gained over us by Satan ; for we are not igno- 
rant of his devices." 



182 II Corinthians 

Perhaps nowhere in the New Testament is 
the subject of the ministry set forth in its 
sublimity as in the section following. He 
first dealt with its power. Describing the 
work of the ministry as a long triumphant 
march, he cited the Corinthian church as an 
evidence of the fact. That triumph was due 
to the fact that the ministry was no longer of 
the letter, but of the Spirit. This told the 
secret of victories won, and revealed the 
nature of the power of the ministry. Passing 
more deeply into the statement of the reason 
of the power and triumph of the ministry, he 
declared the greater glory of the ministration 
of righteousness by the life-giving Spirit. It 
vras the declaration of a message of trans- 
forming life which w^as demonstrated by the 
transformation wrought in those who declared 
the message. The culminating statement in 
the discussion of the subject of power declared 
that the God of original creation has shined 
in the heart giving the ^'light of the knowledge 
of the glory of God in the face of Jesus 
Christ." The earlier part of the paragraph de- 
clares the results of which this statement re- 
veals the cause. They are, as to the ministry, 
"we faint not," "we have renounced the hidden 
things of shame," "we preach . . . Christ 
Jesus as Lord" ; as to the hearers the negative 



A Sequel 133 



result only is referred to, that namely of the 
veiling of the Gospel, the apostle affirming 
that it is only a veiled Gospel to those who 
perish. To summarize, the apostle first de- 
clared that the ministry is a triumphant 
march, and that the church at Corinth was 
the credential of the fact. The reason for this 
is that it is a ministry exercised in the power 
of the Spirit, and consequently transforming 
life. Finally it is a ministry through which 
God Who said, "Let there be light" at the be- 
ginning, says it again in the human heart, so 
that the darkness is dissipated, and the life 
is transformed. 

This ministry, so full of triumph, is yet ex- 
ercised through great tribulation. The treas- 
ure is in earth ern vessels, and these are sub- 
ject to afHiction. This is a revelation of a 
great principle in all successful work. It is 
through the breaking of the earthern vessel 
that light flashes out upon the pathway of 
others. Yet throughout this statement also, 
the other truth is recognized. The power is 
such that all the pressure upon the earthern 
vessel is not sufficient to destroy it. 

Yet once more, tribulations are endured be- 
cause of the hope which burns brightly in the 
midst of travail. The ultimate triumph will 
be that of resurrection; and by comparison 



134 II Corinthians 

with the weight of glory, the burdens and 
afflictions of the ministry are light. Moreover, 
tribulation is seen to be a process which issues 
in victory. Through the travail comes the 
birth, through the suffering comes the 
triumph, through the dying comes the living. 
Beyond the present tabernacle in which there 
is groaning, is the house of God. 

These visions produce no carelessness, but 
consecration. At the portal of the ultimate 
stands the judgment-seat of Christ, where He 
will test our work, destroying that which is 
unworthy, and purifying even the best of its 
dross. 

He next declared the twofold impulse of the 
ministry to be the fear of the Lord, and the 
love of Christ. The second is the exposition 
of the first. Much is gained by the change 
in the Revision from the word "terror" to the 
word "fear." 

Finally the aim of the ministry is that men 
may be reconciled to God. 

Upon the basis of this teaching concerning 
the ministry the apostle made his first appeal. 
Beseeching the Corinthians to be reconciled to 
God, he urged his argument by a description 
of the methods of his own ministry. This was 
an appeal not to outsiders, but to his children 
in the faith, and was for consistency, a^ 



A Sequel 135 



though he would say to them, You are recon- 
ciled to God, be reconciled to God; you have 
received the grace of God, receive it not in 
vain. 

He immediately followed with an appeal 
for consecration. In words full of tenderness, 
he pleaded with them, by declaring his love for 
them, and that they were not straitened in 
him, but in their own affections. He called 
them to separation, citing the great promises 
of God. These promises create the profound- 
est argument, not only because they appeal to 
the highest sentiment, but also, and especially, 
because in their fulfilment will be found power 
sufficient for the perfecting of holiness. The 
call is to separation, and to the putting away 
of filthiness both of flesh and spirit. Where 
this call is obeyed, the promises will be ful- 
filled, and at once the process of perfecting in 
holiness will go forward. 

The section culminates in an appeal full of 
local colouring and suggestion. The apostle, 
evidently conscious that in the case of some, 
at least, he had been excluded from their affec- 
tion, in a great cry gave expression to the 
hunger of his heart when he wrote, "Make 
room for us." He then referred to the period 
of his sorrow in Macedonia, of his joy when 
Titus told him that they had received and been 



136 II Corinthians 

obedient to his letter, and his final word was 
one of magnificent hopefulness, "I rejoice that 
in everything I am of good courage concern- 
ing you." Perhaps there is hardly a chapter 
in the writings of Paul in which the heart of 
the man is more perfectly revealed; and the 
charm of it is to be found in the natural 
humanness which is manifested, and yet which 
all the while is under the constraint of that 
love of Christ which makes the fear of the 
Lord the supreme motive in all life and 
service. 

B. The Collection for the Saints 

The apostle now turned to the subject of 
the collection for the saints at Jerusalem, con- 
cerning which he had written in his previous 
letter. First he reported the action of the 
churches in Macedonia. They had given ac- 
cording to, and even beyond, their power. 
Their method v^-as that they gave themselves. 
If self is given, nothing is Avithheld. 

Then with extreme delicacy the apostle 
urged the Corinthians to emulate so excellent 
an example, citing the example of Christ. 
Turning to the business side of things, he told 
them that Titus and another were sent to en- 
courage them in the carrying out of their liber- 
ality, and was careful to show the necessity 



A Sequel 137 



for avoiding any chance of misinterpretation 
in matters financial, as he wrote, "We take 
thought for things honourable, not only in the 
sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men." 
He then declared the credentials of Titus and 
the other, and appealed to them to act in such 
a way as to prove their love, and vindicate his 
glorying on their behalf. 

In concluding the subject of the collection 
for the saints the apostle declared that he was 
not urging them to give. That they would do, 
but he was desirous that their giving should 
be glad and spontaneous, and that they should 
be well in advance in the matter of bounty, 
and not, as he says, in the matter of extortion. 
In order to stimulate them, he declared that 
such giving was of the nature of seed-sowing, 
and that ever means harvest. In order that 
the harvest may be bountiful let the sowing 
be bountiful. He excluded two methods of 
giving, first, "grudgingly," that is, very liter- 
ally, sorrowfully; "or of necessity," that is, 
the giving of such as simply give from a sense 
of duty, and have not found the higher impulse 
of delight. For the correction of these false 
methods he declared "God loveth a cheerful 
giver."' He then proceeded to declare the ad- 
vantages of giving, or, if we may apply his 
own figure here also, to describe the harvest 



138 II Corinthians 

resulting from such sowing as he urged. The 
first of these was the fact that they would fill 
up the measure of the wants of the saints. 
That in itself was good, but the outcome was 
even better. Through such ministry they 
would create the cause of glory to God. And 
yet again, they would reap the intercession of 
those they helped — a harvest of precious 
value. The final word concerning this whole 
subject w^as an expression of thanks to God 
for His unspeakable gift, for the apostle knew 
that the remembrance of that would do more 
than all his argument to stimulate the gener- 
osity of those who had received the inestima- 
ble blessing. 

c. The Apostle's Coming to Corinth 

In the third division of the letter Paul vin- 
dicated his authority in an argument that cen- 
tred round his proposed visit to them, and the 
criticisms which had been passed on him. In 
this division he seems to have had in mind 
more especially the minority w^ho had been 
opposed to him. He first pleaded with them 
that there might be no necessity for him to 
change the methods that characterized his ac- 
tions when amongst them. Evidently some 
had criticised him as courageous in his ab- 
sence, while they declared him to be lowly 



A Sequel 139 



when present. He declared his readiness if 
need be to be courageous in their presence. 
In answer to the criticism of those who evi 
dently had declared themselves to be Christ'^ 
as the reason for their opposition to him, he in 
turn declared that he also was Christ's, and 
announced his ability to use his authority if 
necessary, finally claiming that he had such 
authority directly from the Lord, and did not 
depend upon self-commendation. 

Having thus referred to authority, he pro- 
ceeded to claim the authority of apostleship. 
After apologizing for boasting and stating the 
reason why he was compelled to do so, he pro- 
ceeded to boast of his apostleship, commencing 
with the remarkable statement that he was 
"not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles," 
as his exercise of the apostolic office proved in 
its manner, its method, and its motive. He 
then plunged into a comparison between him- 
self and some whom the Corinthians had re- 
ceived, giving the credentials of his ministry 
in a passage which gathers up into its sweep 
facts concerning himself, which at once place 
him in the very front rank of the servants of 
Christ. Yet if he himself must needs glory, 
he determined that it should be in the things 
that concerned his weakness, and called God 
to witness as to the truth of what he wrote. 



140 II Corinthians 

His boasting now took on a new and startling 
characteristic. In the history of his apostle- 
ship there had been something supernatural, 
and not to be finally explained. Of this he 
would glory. He had received direct and re- 
markable revelations which it was not possible 
for him to speak of in detail. The purpose of 
these revelations had evidently been that of 
giving him courage and confidence in his work, 
for their peril lay in the direction of his be- 
coming "exalted overmuch.'' With reference 
to the thorn in the flesh, which followed the 
revelations, he declared, "Now will I rather 
glory in my weaknesses, that the power of 
Christ may rest upon me." As the section 
concerning his apostleship commenced with 
an apology for boasting it closes in the same 
way. Yet he declared, "Ye compelled me." 
As his actual glorying began with a statement 
of his apostolic authority by comparison with 
others, so now he ended in the same Avay. "In 
nothing was I behind the very chiefest apos- 
tles, though I am nothing." 

As the letter drew to conclusion the apostle 
was careful to make perfectly clear what his 
attitude in writing had been. All his dealing 
with them had been conditioned within three 
facts; first, it had been in the sight of God; 
second, it had been in Christ; and third, it 



A Sequel 141 



had been for their edifviug. He cared little 
for their approval of his conduct, but much 
for their being approved before God. Out of 
such desire he delivered his message under the 
sense of responsibility to God, and with a 
consciousness of its authority, because he 
spoke in Christ. 

Finally he announced the method of his 
third coming to them to be that of a severe 
investigation, and declared that when he came 
they would have a proof of Christ's speaking 
in him. He then urged them to personal ex- 
amination. They were to test themselves, and 
to prove whether they were in the faith. 

Conclusion 

The last words are words of cheer. A series 
of brief exhortations indicate what their true 
attitude should be. Then follows the declara- 
tion that "the God of love and peace shall be 
with you," and all concludes with the benedic- 
tion, and it is to be carefully noted that this 
letter, which is perhaps the severest that the 
apostle wrote, yet ends with the benediction in 
its fullest and most gracious terms.

GALATIANS 

GALATIA was a district of Asia Minor, 
and is first mentioned in connection with 
PauPs second journey. No details are given 
of his work in this region, but in all proba- 
bility in connection with that first visit the 
churches addressed in this epistle were 
formed. He visited them again, establishing 
them. 

In these brief references, however, no par- 
ticulars are given concerning them. The let- 
ter shows that Judaizing teachers had found 
their way into the region, and as a result much 
harm had been wrought among the new con- 
verts. These teachers had questioned the 
apostle^s authority, contradicted his doctrine, 
and so produced conduct contrary to the 
Christian standard. 

The epistle was written with a view to the 
correction of these errors. After an Introduc- 
tion (i. 1-10) it falls into three divisions; an 
Apology, the Defence of the Gospel ( i. 11-ii. ) ; 
an Argument, the Declaration of the Gospel 
(iii.-v. 1) ; an Appeal, the Demands of the 
Gospel (v.-vi. 10), Conclusion (vi. 11-18).

146 Galatians 



Introduction 

In the beginning of most of his epistles Paul 
definitely declared his apostleship. In this 
instance he defended that declaration more 
emphatically than in any other introduction. 
With extreme care both on the negative and 
positive sides he made his claim. There are 
no personal salutations, but he does not omit 
the general salutation of the gospel. 

As there are no words of personal saluta- 
tion, so also there are no expressions of thank- 
fulness for their condition. Instead of the 
usual "I thank my God," he wrote, "I marvel." 
The false teachers were perverting the Gospel 
of Christ. So terrible a thing was this to the 
mind of the writer that twice in the introduc- 
tion a curse is pronounced upon those causing 
the trouble. The line of teaching followed by 
these men is not definitely stated, but may be 
gathered by an examination of the epistle. The 
one thing certain is that it was subversive of 
the evangel of the Cross, and there is a note 
of passion in this introduction which runs 
throughout the whole letter. 

A. An Apology. Defence op the Gospel 

In defence of the Gospel the apostle wrote 
an apology which falls into three parts, the 



Christ the Emancipator 147 



first being a statement of its authority, the 
second a declaration that such authority was 
confirmed by conference; and the third, an 
account of how that authority was maintained 
in conflict with Peter. 

The apostle first enforced the Divine origin 
and consequent authority of his Gospel by 
three arguments deduced from his own experi- 
ence. He had not learned it from others, but 
had received it by direct revelation from Jesus 
Christ. He had obeyed its call without con- 
sultation. Holding no conference with flesh 
and blood, not even going up to Jerusalem, he 
had departed into Arabia. When at last he 
had come to Jerusalem, it was not for official 
recognition, but to make the acquaintance of 
Peter; and his only relation to the church of 
Judaea was that he gave it occasion of rejoic- 
ing in the success attending his work. The 
Divine element vindicating the authority of 
his Gospel is clearly marked. There was first 
the revelation to him of Jesus Christ, by which 
he received his Gospel; then the revelation in 
him of the Son of God, w^hich constituted the 
inspiration and power of his obedience; and 
finally such revelation through him that the 
churches of Judaea glorified God in him. The 
argument of all this is that the authority of 
his Gospel is demonstrated, by the fact that he 



148 Galatians 



received it directly, by the effect it produced 
on him, and by what it had accomplished 
through him. 

Having thus dealt with the Divine authority 
of His Gospel the apostle proceeded to claim 
that that authority was confirmed by a confer- 
ence which he had with the elders in Jeru- 
salem fourteen years after his conversion. He 
declared that he went up by revelation in the 
interests of his work, and because of false 
brethren. He declared that at that confer- 
ence the elders of the church imparted noth- 
ing to him, nay rather having heard him, they 
acknowledge the rectitude of his conduct, and 
the soundness of his positions, and gave to him 
and his colleague, Barnabas, the right hand of 
fellowship. Thus the authority of his Gospel 
was confirmed by conference. 

His third argument was that of the main- 
tenance of the authority of his Gospel even 
in conflict with Peter. The dissimulation of 
Peter was of so grave a nature that Paul re- 
buked him before the whole company of be- 
lievers, urging upon him the necessity for con- 
sistency, declaring that it was because the law 
could not justify that they had put their faith 
in Christ; thus showing the absolute futility 
of returning to legal observances and distinc- 
tions, from all of which they had already 



Christ the Emancipator 149 

turned. He ended his apology by the great 
word of personal testimony in which he out- 
lined the Christian life both as to its negative 
and positive aspect. ''Crucified with Christ/' 
"No longer I that live/' these declare how the 
believer has died to law; "Christ liveth in 
me/' "I live in faith/' these reveal how, 
through identification with death, the believer 
henceforth lives unto God. 

B. An Argument. Declaration of the 
Gospel 

Having thus defended the Gospel, the 
apostle now proceeded to declare its essential 
message. This he did by first affirming that 
justification is by faith; then by showing the 
relation of the lav/ to this ; and finally by illus- 
trative enforcement of the truth. 

In affirming that justification is by faith, 
he appealed first to Galatian experience, de- 
scribing the course of their spiritual life; 
Jesus Christ "set forth" ; the Spirit received by 
faith ; suffering resulting, and the Spirit sup- 
plied, and wonders wrought by faith. Show- 
ing that faith was the reason of Abraham's 
blessing, he declared that the true sons of 
Abraham are they that are of faith. This 
affirmation of faith as the condition of bless- 
ing, led him to a statement of the alternative, 



150 Galatians 



and it is almost startling in its definite clear- 
ness. "As many as are under the works of the 
law are under the curse," for the law curses 
imperfection, cannot justify, and demands 
perfection. From this curse of the law Christ, 
by His Cross, delivers. Thus His Cross be- 
comes the basis of the faith which justifies. 

He then proceeded to show the relation of 
the law to this Gospel. The covenant of 
faith, based upon a promise, was four hundred 
and thirty years older than the law ; and there- 
fore the law could not make it void, or add to 
it. The law, then, was a temporary arrange- 
ment only until the coming of the Seed, to 
which it led on, because through faith in that 
Seed the promise originally made to faith 
would be realized. Therefore the law exer- 
cised discipline, and watched over conduct, and 
so was a custodian, until Christ by settling 
the question of sin, created the foundation 
for faith, and vindicated its confidence. Christ 
not only opened the prison-house by dealing 
with sin; He also communicated to those be- 
lieving, a new life. That new life cancels all 
old differences. Thus the new-born are 
Abraham's seed, not according to, or by the 
way of law, but according to promise. This 
is the Christian doctrine of liberty from the 
law. 



Christ the Emancipator 151 

In illustrative enforcement of the truth, the 
apostle first instituted a comparison between 
the old and the new under the figure of the 
difference between childhood and sonship. 
Under the old economy men were children, 
that is, minors. Under the new, God sent 
forth His Son to provide redemption, and His 
Spirit to provide regeneration, whereby those 
trusting become sons, that is majors. On the 
basis of that contrast he revealed the peril 
threatening those who turned back to the old, 
under which God was unknown. In Christ 
He is known, and to turn back is to return to 
weak and beggarly elements, that is, to things 
unable to lift, and poverty-stricken. 

At this point the apostle wrote a tender and 
beautiful personal appeal. Eeminding them 
of the way in which they had received him, 
he asked, did he become their enemy by telling 
them the truth ; and immediately put into con- 
trast with himself those who had been trou- 
bling them, ending his appeal with an outcry 
like that of a mother. 

Then, asking them if they really desired to 
be under the law, he put the law and the Gos- 
pel into contrast, by a comparison between 
Ishmael and Isaac ; the first being the son of 
the bondwoman, and the second the son of 
the free woman. Those in Christ are the chil- 



152 Galatians 



dren of promise, who must therefore cast out 
the bondwoman. 

c. An Appeal. Demands of the Gospel 

The last division of his letter is a great ap- 
peal setting forth the demands of the Gospel. 
In this the writer first declared that freedom 
must be maintained; then showed that free- 
dom is in order to the realization of purpose; 
and finally taught that freedom is mutual. 

The law of liberty is stated in the opening 
sentence. Its privilege is described in the 
words, "For freedom did Christ set us free"; 
and its responsibility in the positive "Stand 
fast," and the negative "Be not entangled." The 
alternatives of entanglement and freedom he 
then dealt with more fully. The former meant 
severance from Christ; the latter separation 
from all the things that spoil. This teaching 
that freedom must be maintained he concluded 
with an appeal in which he challenged them 
as to who had hindered them, and declared 
his confidence toward them in the Lord. 

Continuing, he insisted upon the necessity 
for remembering that freedom is in order to 
realization. Their liberty was not intended 
to be fleshly license, but rather the law of life 
in the Spirit; and he put into contrast the 
works of the flesh, and the fruit of the Spirit. 



Christ the Emancipator 153 

Having thus broadly dealt with the prin- 
ciple, the apostle made some application 
thereof. The attitude of the free toward fail- 
ure in others is to be that of gentleness and 
service toward restoration. The attitude of 
the free toward those who are burdened, that 
is, oppressed, weighed down with sorrow or 
suffering, is to be that of helping to bear such 
burdens. The attitude of the free toward per- 
sonal responsibility is to be that of bearing 
the burden, realizing that none can assist. 



Conclusion 

After a personal reference, somewhat ob- 
scure, but which suggests a physical affliction, 
making it necessary for the apostle to write in 
large characters, he summarized the whole 
subject of the false teachers. The principle 
upon which they had acted is that of desiring 
to make a fair show in the flesh in order to 
escape persecution. As against this, his atti- 
tude had been that of glorying in the Cross. 
He finally pronounced peace and mercy upon 
such as walked by that rule of glorying, and 
upon the "Israel of God.'' The use of this 
phrase at the close of the letter is suggestive 
in the light of his argument that the true seed 
of Abraham consists of the sons of faith, and 



154 Galatians 



that the Jerusalem which is from above is the 
mother of those who are justified by faith. 

With a touch of fine independence he wrote, 
"Henceforth let no man trouble me; for I 
bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus." 
The very shame and suffering and persecution 
which the false teachers would escape, the 
apostle declared had stamped him with the 
true insignia of his office. The scars upon his 
body left by the stripes and the stones spoke 
of his loyalty to, and fellowship with his 
Master; and rendered him splendidly inde- 
pendent of all human opinion, and declining 
to be troubled by any man. The letter closes 
with a benediction.

EPHESIANS 

IT is open to question whether this letter 
was originally sent to the church at 
Ephesus alone, or to a group of churches in 
Asia, of which Ephesus was one. The words 
"at Ephesus" are considered to be doubtful. 
The fact that there is no salutation, or directly 
personal matter in the letter, would seem to 
lend force to the idea that it was intended 
for a group of churches. Unlike many of the 
other letters of Paul, this one does not seem 
to have been called out by any local circum- 
stance, but is rather a document concerning 
the whole Church. 

The absence of local colouring makes it un- 
necessary to dwell upon the history of the 
church at Ephesus. All of it, so far as re- 
corded, is to be found in the Acts, and in the 
Apocalypse. 

The letter may be spoken of as the Mani- 
festo of the Church's ultimate vocation. In it 
the apostle is no longer dealing in detail with 
the fundamental doctrine of salvation as he 
did in the letter to the Romans, nor with the 
Church's equipment for present service, as in 

157 



158 Ephesians 



those to the Corinthians; but with the still 
more glorious matter of the Church's eternal 
vocation. This, however, is not a doctrine re- 
vealed merely for the sake of the instruction 
of the intelligence of the believer. It has its 
bearing upon the present life, and while the 
first half of the epistle deals with the heavenly 
calling, the second half shows the effect that 
will be produced by an understanding of this 
upon the present life. 

The contents may thus simply be analyzed; 
Introduction (i. 1-2) ; the Church, the 
heavenly Calling (i. 3-iii.) ; the Church, the 
earthly Conduct (iv.-vi. 18) ; Conclusion (vi. 
19-24). 

Introduction ' 

The apostle introduced himself by claiming 
apostleship through the will of God, and then 
carefully defined those to whom the letter is 
addressed. He wrote to the saints, that is, 
to such as live by faith in Christ Jesus. He 
saluted his readers with the benediction of 
grace and peace. 

A. The Church. The heavenly Calling 

The main object of the letter is suggested by 
the benediction which affirms the blessedness 
of God, and declares that He has conferred 
blessing upon the saints in Christ. 



The Eternal Vocation 159 

Following closely upon this introductory 
benediction, the subject of the Church's 
heavenly calling is commenced. It falls into 
three sections : Predestination, or the Church's 
origin; Edification, or the Church's construc- 
tion; Vocation, or the Church's function. 

Before the foundation of the world God 
chose One, even Christ, and all who put their 
faith in Him. God's predestination of the 
saints was to such relationship with Christ 
as should issue in their being holy, in order to 
the manifestation of His grace. Predestina- 
tion was not only to this purpose, but in- 
cluded the method of redemption by blood, the 
revelation and consequent realization of grace 
in the character of such as believed. This 
doctrine of grace created desires in the heart 
of the apostle for the saints, which he ex- 
pressed in prayer. This prayer asked that 
they might have a full knowledge of the pur- 
pose, and of the power at their disposal for its 
realization. 

Passing to the subject of the edification, or 
building of the Church according to the pre- 
destined purpose and method, he first de- 
scribed the materials of the building. These 
are individuals living in the midst of condi- 
tions absolutely opposed to the will and pur- 
pose of God. These are made alive, raised up, 



160 Ephesians 



made to sit in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus. 
The words "in Christ Jesus" refer to the 
whole process. Thus out of the deep and aw- 
ful darkness God brings, through Christ, the 
materials with which He will build His 
Church. These are His workmanship as to 
preparation. The apostle then passed to the 
subject of the unification of these materials 
into one building. Writing to Gentiles, he 
declared that Jew and Gentile were to be 
united in Christ. Those united become "a 
holy temple in the Lord," the purpose of which 
is that it should be "a habitation of God in the 
Spirit." The creation of the temple is accom- 
plished through the work of Christ. The in- 
coming of the Spirit appropriates the temple 
according to the intended purpose. Thus the 
edification or building of the Church goes for- 
ward according to predestination. 

Dealing with the vocation of the Church the 
apostle showed that God's dwelling therein 
is not finality, but rather equipment. By the 
Church, God Himself is equipped for the dis- 
play of His blessedness. By the indwelling 
Spirit the Church is equipped for the fulfil- 
ment of her Divine purpose. That purpose is, 
that to the high intelligences, "the principali- 
ties and powers in the heavenlies," the Church 
is to be the medium for the manifestation of 



The Eternal Vocation 161 

"the manifold wisdom of God." The stupen- 
dous magnitude of the subject is clearly set 
forth in the second prayer of the apostle, 
which proceeded through causes to an effect. 
The final petition was "that ye may be filled 
unto all the fulness of God." In order to this 
he prayed that they might be rooted and 
grounded in love, and so, strong to apprehend. 
In order to this he prayed that Christ might 
dwell in their hearts. In order to this he 
prayed that they might be strengthened with 
power through the Spirit. The division ends 
with the great doxology. So stupendous is 
the idea developed that in the presence of it 
faith staggers, save as it recognizes that God 
bestows power equal to the accomplishment 
of the purpose. That power is already at 
work in those who are saints by faith in 
Christ. 

B. The Church. The earthly Conduct 

The apostle at once moved to the applica- 
tion of this great doctrine to the present life 
of the Church, and dealt with it as it con- 
cerns the Church as such, as it affects conduct, 
and as it creates conflict. 

The first responsibility of the Church is that 
it maintain the unity of the Spirit. Having 
described the unity as to the process of its 



162 Ephesians 



creation, and its glorious inclusiveness, he 
dealt with its growth. In doing so he main- 
tained the figure of his previous section, that 
of building; and yet it is the building of a liv- 
ing organism. To every individual, grace is 
given, in order that all may grow up toward 
the ultimate fulness of the entire Church, 
which he described as a "full grown man, the 
measure of the stature of the fulness of 
Christ." There is an individual bestowment 
of grace from the Head in order that there 
may be mutual growth into right relationship, 
and simultaneous action, with the Head. 

Turning to the subject of conduct, he dealt 
first with individual responsibility. In a 
series of eight remarkable contrasts, illustrat- 
ing the difference between the old life and the 
new, he urged the believer to put off the for- 
mer, and to put on the latter. These contrasts 
are between lying and truth, malice and 
mercy, stealing and giving, corrupting and edi- 
fying speech, hatred and love, purity and im- 
purity, folly and wisdom, excitement and 
enthusiasm. This whole section of contrasts 
and injunctions must be considered and 
obeyed in the light of the opening words, which 
describe inclusively the earthly conduct of the 
people of the heavenly calling. "Walk 
worthily of the calling." Two commands may 



The Eternal Vocation 163 

be spoken of as the dynamic centres. First, 
"Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, in Whom 
ye were sealed unto the day of redemption," 
and "Be filled with the Spirit." 

Passing from the question of individual con- 
duct the apostle approached that of the Chris- 
tian family, dealing first with the heads 
thereof, husbands and wives. The wife is to 
be subject to the love of the husband, finding 
the fulfilment of the natural capacities of 
the love of woman in trusting so perfectly 
the loved one, as to rejoice in his guidance and 
direction, knowing that it is the expression 
of his love. The apostle's teaching concern- 
ing the husband was the exact correlative of 
that concerning the wife. He spoke only of 
his love, which is to be self-emptying, and is 
to have as its purpose the perfecting of the 
wife. The radiant vision of the perfect love 
of Christ to His Church, and the true ideal 
of the Church's love to Christ, is the pattern of 
the relationship which ought to exist between 
husband and wife. The heads of the house- 
hold are to bear such relation to each other 
as is worthy of that high calling of the 
Church, which is made possible in the glorious 
union existing between her and her Lord. 
Concerning children the apostle had two com- 
mands, which should be carefully dis- 



164 Ephesians 



tinguished. The first is that they are to obey, 
and the second that they are to honour their 
parents. Obedience is the attitude of the 
child under age, during the process of train- 
ing, and ends with the coming of manhood and 
womanhood. The duty of honouring parents 
never ends. The responsibility of parents is 
stated only with reference to fathers. The 
exercise of authority is to be on the principle 
of reasonableness ; and its method that of nur- 
ture, which suggests the thought of develop- 
ment; chastening, which includes restraint in 
all its forms ; and admonition, which is that of 
warning. 

The wider circle of the Christian household 
is dealt with as to the relationship between 
servants and masters. Servants are to obey, 
always remembering that their final reward 
comes from the hand of Christ. The master 
is ever to have in mind, as the revelation of 
his true relation to his servant, his own Mas- 
ter in heaven, and is to remember that with 
the Lord is no respect of persons. 

The last section of the second division of 
the letter deals with conflict. It is signifi- 
cant that at the close of so great an argument 
concerning the heavenly calling and the 
earthly conduct, the apostle should recognize 
the fact that life on earth after the pattern 



The Eternal Vocation 165 

of the heavens necessarily brings conflict with 
all the forces that are opposed to God. He 
recognized that behind all the opposition of 
man is the more terrific opposition of spiritual 
forces. While the teaching realizes that the 
conflict is indeed a terrible one, there is not a 
single note that indicates the necessity for 
cowardly fear. Perfect provision is made for 
the saint in the "whole armour of God." If 
advantage is taken of this provision, conflict 
always issues in victory. The armour must 
not only be put on, it must be taken up; and 
the soldier must fight. His true attitude in 
conflict is that of dependence upon God in 
prayer. 

Conclusion 

The final injunction in the previous section 
concerning prayer, merges into the personal 
element with which the apostle concluded. 
They were to remember him as "an ambassa- 
dor in chains.'' The letter closes with a bene- 
diction, consisting of w^ords of peace and of 
grace, in w^hich the Source of blessing, "God 
the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ," and 
the recipients thereof, "all them that love our 
Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptness," are 
brought together in suggestive sentences.

PHILIPPIANS. 

PHILIPPI was the first city in Europe in 
which Paul preached. His letter to the 
Philippians differs from other of his writings 
in that it seems to have no definite scheme of 
teaching. It is, however, of the utmost value 
as a revelation of Christian experience. The 
word sin is not mentioned. The flesh is only 
referred to that it may be ignored. There 
are no direct reproofs, the nearest approach 
to one being the exhortation to Euodia and 
Syntyche. It is largely personal, a letter of 
the heart, written by one who loves, to those 
whom he loves, and Avho love him. Its atmos- 
phere is that of joy, and this is the more re- 
markable seeing that it was written from 
prison. 

Some of the sublimest things concerning 
Christ and the Christian life are written here. 
Recognizing the difificulty of analysis, and re- 
membering that the ultimate value of the let- 
ter is its revelation of the triumph of Chris- 
tian experience in joy over all adverse circum- 
stances, it may be divided thus; Introduction 
(i. 1, 2) ; Experience (i. 3-26) ; Exposition (i. 
169

27-iv. 1) ; Exhortation (iv. 2-20) ; Conclusion 
(iv. 21-23). 

Introduction 

Paul's association of Timothy with himself 
in these introductions is an act of gracious 
identification with his beloved son in the faith. 
In this letter, for the first time, officers of 
the church are named in the introduction — 
"bishops and deacons." These, according to 
the New Testament ideal, are the two orders 
of the servants of the Church; first, the 
bishops, or overseers, who are entrusted with 
the spiritual responsibility ; secondly, the dea- 
cons, who are to serve tables, or attend to the 
business details. It is worthy of notice that 
these are not named first, seeing that they 
are only of importance in the measure in 
which they serve the interests of all the saints. 

A. Experience 

In writing to his children at Philippi the 
apostle first poured forth his own experience 
of joy, and in doing so revealed the joy of ex- 
perience, and the joy of expectation. 

His memory of them filled his heart with 
thankfulness, and the activity of such joy was 
that of prayer on their behalf. His ultimate 
desire for them was that they might approve 



Christ the Secret of Joy 171 

the things that are excellent, in order that 
they might be sincere, and void of offence unto 
the day of Christ. 

The apostle then turned to the subject of 
his experience in prison, using the phrase "my 
bonds'' three times in quick succession. Thus 
we see the circumstances under which he 
wrote. He declared that these things "have 
fallen out rather unto the progress of the 
Gospel." It had become known that he was a 
prisoner because of his relation to Christ, and 
this had been his opportunity to testify for 
his Lord; and his brethren had become con- 
fident as the result. He rejoiced moreover in 
the fact that Christ was preached, even though 
some were doing it of faction. All this is a 
radiant revelation of the triumph of Chris- 
tian experience over all circumstances. 

Out of the midst of such circumstances he 
looked on, and expressed his confidence that 
"Christ shall be magnified in my body, 
whether by life or by death." From the purely 
personal aspect, death would be very far bet- 
ter. On the other hand, to abide would be to 
have new opportunity of service. The triumph 
is on the side of that service rather than on 
that of selfish interest, even of the highest 
kind. He was confident that he would abide. 

Thus his whole experience was that of joy- 



172 Philippians 



ful triumph over the most trying and difficult 
circumstances, because of his relation to 
Christ. 

B. Exposition 

His interest in, and care for his children 
at Philippi now expressed itself in an exposi- 
tion of that very experience which he had 
described, and he taught them what is the 
manner of the life worthy of the Gospel, what 
is the mind of Christ which will produce such 
manner of life, and finally described the atti- 
tudes Avhich would enable them to rejoice in 
the Lord. 

The manner of life worthy of the Gospel is 
that of maintaining unity, manifesting cour- 
age, and sharing in suffering. As in his own 
case the apostle measured all the circum- 
stances of the hour by the effect they pro- 
duced on the great work of the progress of the 
Gospel, so he tested the manner of life of 
these children of his love by the measure in 
which it ministered to the same great result. 

In order to such manner of life the great 
necessity is the mind of Christ. This he first 
urged upon them, and then in a stupendous 
and stately passage unfolded the nature of 
that mind. Its master principle is that of 
love, first as the motive of self-emptying; and 



Christ the Secret of Joy 173 

secondly, as the reason of Divine exalting. 
The examination of this passage should be un- 
dertaken in lonely and reverent contempla- 
tion. Turning back to Paul's first word iu 
this section, "If there is therefore any com- 
fort in Christ,'^ and considering it in the light 
of this unveiling, its value is discovered. The 
statement introduced by the word "if" is seen 
to be of that superlative nature which admits 
of no contradiction. The manner of life which 
is worthy of the Gospel must be impulsed by 
the mind that was in Christ. The apostle 
therefore passed immediately to his next in- 
junction, an examination of which reveals the 
value of the mind of Christ. There is to be 
the working out into visibility of that salva- 
tion which God wills and works within. The 
result of this will be, that in the midst of a 
crooked and perverse generation they will be 
seen as lights in the world. Thus the whole 
section on the mind of Christ is seen to be 
intimately connected with the one that deals 
with the manner of life worthy of the Gospel. 
The life, love-impulsed in obedience to the in- 
dwelling of Christ, and love-controlled in sub- 
mission to the Divine inworking by the Spirit, 
is in itself a light dissipating darkness. He 
declared in conclusion that if these ideals be 
fulfilled, there will be cause for glorying in 



174 Philippians 



the day of Christ, and therefore such as 
minister the Word may joy and rejoice, even 
though poured out as a drink-offering. 

Immediately following is a passage in which 
he spoke of his hope of sending Timothy, and 
his determination to send Epaphroditus, in 
which the point of value is that of the prin- 
ciple of the apostle's selection of these mes- 
sengers. Timothy is not among the number of 
those who seek their own. Epaphroditus he 
spoke of as "your messenger, and a minister to 
my need." He was to be sent back to help 
them, the apostle having noticed how he 
longed after them, and was troubled concern- 
ing them, because they had heard that he was 
sick. 

Having appealed to the Philippian Chris- 
tians to fulfil his joy, the apostle now urged 
them to rejoice. The ultimate attitude of life 
worthy of the Gospel in the impulse of the 
mind of Christ is that of rejoicing. Having 
definitely stated the duty, the apostle pro- 
ceeded first to warn them of the peril that 
threatens joy, that of conformity to the ma- 
terial ceremonies from which they had es- 
caped, and ultimately laid upon them their 
responsibility. 

Between this warning against the peril, and 
declaration of responsibility, we have his great 



Christ the Secret of Joy 175 

autobiographical paragraph. This paragraph 
shows how he had lived in the midst of the 
things against which he warned them; and 
how, when apprehended of Christ, he turned 
from them to the attitude which he laid upon 
them as responsibilities. Thus the old story 
of his own experience becomes an illustration 
of how they might fulfil his injunction to re- 
joice. His past life was a remarkable one, in 
that it realized the possibilities of the old 
economy at their highest and best; but the 
vision of Christ was such that not by gradual 
elimination, or slow and tedious process, but 
immediately, he had counted all the things in 
which he had trusted as valueless. Turning 
to the positive side, he described the deter- 
mination and devotion of his whole life to the 
one supreme object of apprehending that for 
which Christ had apprehended him. 

Then follows his statement of the responsi- 
bility of those who are to fulfil the injunction 
to rejoice in the Lord. They are to walk by 
the same rule, that is, make progress, accord- 
ing to the principles already learned. He de- 
scribed the true attitude of the Christian, and 
in the midst of his description in a parenthe- 
sis for the sake of contrast, referred to those 
who were walking in such a way as to cause 
him sorrow. The true walk has as its motive 



176 Philippians 



the consciousness of heavenly citizenship, and 
its direction is toward the goal of life, which 
is the completion of salvation at the advent 
of the Lord. Therefore they were to stand 
fast in the Lord. 

c. Exhortation 

The last division of the letter is occupied 
with exhortation, and is in harmony with all 
that has preceded it. The apostle first gave an 
illustration of the necessity for exhortation, 
and then showed the treatment of all such 
cases, finally revealing his perfect confidence 
in his children at Philippi. 

The illustration is that afforded by the case 
of Euodia and Syntyche. Evidently there had 
been some difference between them, which was 
to be healed ; and moreover, in all probability 
on account of this difference, they had been 
somewhat neglected by others in the fellow- 
ship. This neglect was to cease. 

Whereas that which follows has a far wider 
application than the case of Euodia and Syn- 
tyche, that wider application is most clearly 
seen if w^e consider the teaching first, as it 
would touch this particular case. Differences 
are to be dealt with by rejoicing, forbearing, 
praying, the result being that the peace of God 
will guard the heart and the thought. The 



Christ the Secret of Joy 177 

peace of God is His quietness, His certainty 
based upon His infinite knowledge and unlim- 
ited power. All possibility of neglecting cer- 
tain of the saints because of their failure is for 
evermore corrected, as the things of glory and 
of beauty, which the apostle lists, are thought 
upon. These things, moreover, they were to 
do, and the result would be that the God of 
peace would be with them. 

Drawing to the conclusion of his letter, the 
apostle expressed thankfulness for the loving 
thought manifest in the saints of Philippi in 
their having ministered to his need. This ex- 
pression called forth words w^hich afford a 
revelation of the deepest experience of his 
life. He is able to be content in any circum- 
stances through Christ. And yet again he 
expressed his gratification at their care of 
him, in order that he might tell them the deep- 
est reason of his thankfulness. It was not 
that he had been enriched, but that their giv- 
ing meant "fruit that increaseth to your ac- 
count." His confidence for them was finally 
based upon the Divine provision for them, 
which he expressed in the great and gracious 
w^ords "My God shall fulfil every need of 
yours according to His riches in glory in 
Christ Jesus." The doxology is a fitting ex- 
pression of the experience of the Christian 



178 Philippians 



as it has been revealed throughout the epistle. 
This prisoner of the Lord Jesus, recognizing 
his relationship to God, ascribed to Him the 
glory, and is thus seen to be superior to all 
the limitation of life which characterized his 
position. That ascription of glory, moreover, 
is "unto the ages of the ages," and thus the 
man who, as this letter reveals in its com- 
mencement, was living so much a day at a 
time that he did not know whether life or 
death awaited him on the morrow, was su- 
perior to all care on that account, because in 
Christ he stood in confident relation to the 
vast and unmeasured ages. 

Conclusion 

The final words are those of personal and 
tender salutation, followed by pronouncement 
of the single and inclusive benediction of the 
grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.

COLOSSIANS 

WE have no information concerning the 
founding of the Church at Colossae, and 
it is probable that when this letter was writ- 
ten, Paul had not visited it. The occasion of 
the writing of the letter seems to have been 
that information had reached the apostle that 
false teachers were troubling the Church, at- 
tempting to supplement the Christian system 
by ascetic practices, and a doctrine concern- 
ing the intermediation of angels. The apostle 
combats these errors by declaring the absolute 
sufficiency of Christ. The epistle may there- 
fore be described as a statement concerning 
the glory of Christ Who is the Head of the 
Church ; and the consequent perfection of pro- 
vision for the Church in Him. 

This letter is, as to doctrine, correlative to 
that to the Ephesians. The Ephesian epistle 
deals with the glorious vocation of the Church 
in its union with the Head ; the Colossian let- 
ter deals with the glory of the Head, as at the 
disposal of the Church. In this, the subject 
is that of the fulness of God in Christ, and 
the Church's participation in that fulness; 

181 



182 Colossians 



in that, the subject is that of the Church as 
the medium for the display of the glory of 
God in union with Christ. In dealing with his 
great theme the apostle first wrote of the 
glorious Christ and His Church; then of the 
Church and her glorious Christ, the first di- 
vision being devoted to the subject of the 
Church's provision in Christ, and the second 
the Church's possession of Christ. The 
scheme of the epistle may thus be stated; In- 
troduction (i. 1-8) ; The Glorious Christ and 
His Church ; Provision ( i. 9-ii. 5 ) ; the Church 
and Her Glorious Christ; Possession (ii. 6-iv. 
6) ; Conclusion (iv. 7-18). 

Introduction 

After the usual introduction of himself as 
"an apostle . . . through the will of God," 
Paul declared to the Colossian Christians the 
gladness of his heart at the news which 
Epaphroditus had brought to him concerning 
them. The reasons of his thankfulness are, 
first their "faith in Christ Jesus"; second 
their "love . . . toward all the saints"; and 
third their "hope . . . laid up ... in the 
heavens." The apostle indicated the connection 
between these essential graces of Christian 
character. Faith in Christ issues in love to 
the saints, and this sequence is consequent 



Mutual Fulness 183 

upon the hope. In proportion as the heart is 
set upon the apprehension of all that for 
which Christ has apprehended the believer, 
faith is constant, and love profound. 

A great carefulness of statement is evident 
in this letter. In both divisions the same 
method is followed. The systematic statement 
is preceded by an introductory word, and fol- 
lowed by a suitable application. 

A. The Glorious Christ and His Church. 
Provision 

The apostle introduced his subject by de- 
claring the constancy of his prayer, then pre- 
sented the glorious Christ, and the glorious 
Church, concluding with a statement of the 
reason of his writing. 

The apostle was conscious that the supreme 
need of those to whom he wrote was that they 
might "be filled with the knowledge of His 
will," and that, in order that they might "walk 
worthily of the Lord." He was conscious of 
the absolutely perfect provision made for the 
saints in Christ, and his prayer merged into 
a declaration concerning it. Two words indi- 
cate the values of that provision — "delivered," 
"translated," that is, salvation out of, and 
into. The old forces which dominated the 
life, and made impossible the achievement of 



184 Colossians 



good even when it was seen and admired, are 
no longer operative. From this slavery of 
darkness the saints have been delivered. They 
are brought into the "Kingdom of the Son of 
His love." Instead of the power of darkness 
there is now the authority of light. Instead of 
the thraldom of the forces that spoil there is 
now the dominance of the One Who saves and 
perfects. 

All this leads to his declarations concern- 
ing the glorious Christ. He first dealt with 
the glories of His Person. These he set forth 
in three relationships, by an inclusive state- 
ment. His relation to God is that of "the 
Image of the invisible God." His relation to 
creation is that He is the originating Cause 
and the upholding Power thereof. His rela- 
tion to the Church is that He is the Head. 
The whole truth is summarized in the sublime 
and awe-inspiring declaration that "it was the 
good pleasure of the Father that in Him 
should all the fulness dwell." 

He then passed to a statement of the glori- 
ous purpose of His earthly mission. The ex- 
tent of that purpose is the reconciliation of 
all things to God. In the fall of man, dis- 
cord was introduced into the cosmos. The 
purpose of God is to restore the lost harmony 
by reconciling all things to Himself. The im- 



Mutual Fulness 185 

mediate Agent of the restoration is Christ, 
and the method is that of the Cross. At the 
centre of the order to be reconciled is man, 
and the issue of his reconciliation is his pres- 
entation "holy . . . without blemish . . . un- 
reprovable/' 

The company of those redeemed constitutes 
the glorious Church, which is the Body of 
Christ. In dealing with this subject the 
apostle declared his joy in the fact that he 
had fellowship with Christ in the accomplish- 
ment of His purpose, and claimed the steward- 
ship of the truth concerning the Church, and 
then dealt with it by referring to a threefold 
mystery. The first phase of the mystery is 
that of the Church itself, which is composed 
of Christian souls. The second phase of the 
mystery is that of the Christian in whom is 
Christ as the Hope of glory, and who is per- 
fected in Christ. The final and deepest mys- 
tery is that of the Christ Himself. It is the 
mystery of the Incarnation, transcending all 
human apprehension, and yet demonstrated 
in the changed lives of those in whom Christ 
dwells, and to be manifested finally in the 
whole company of such as constitute the 
Church, which is the Body of Christ. 

Taking this threefold mystery in the other 
order of statement, which is the order of the 



186 Colossians 



Divine procedure, we have first the mystery 
of God, even Christ; second, the mystery of 
Christ in man, the Hope of glory ; and finally, 
the mystery of the perfected Church, Christ 
fulfilled in His Body. 

This division he concluded by declaring, that 
his reason for having so carefully stated this 
doctrine of Christ and the Church, is that the 
Colossian Christians may not be deluded with 
persuasiveness of speech. Though he was ab- 
sent from them, he declared that he was with 
them in spirit, finding his joy in the stead- 
fastness of their faith in Christ. 

B. The Church and Her Glorious Christ. 
Possession 

The apostle introduced his subject by in- 
junction and w^arning, and a general state- 
ment of truth; he then particularly declared 
the truth concerning the identification of the 
Church with Christ, and Christ's identifica- 
tion with the Church ; concluding with a state- 
ment of the conditions upon which the saints 
are to possess their inheritance. 

He first enjoined them that as they had re- 
ceived Christ the Lord they were to walk in 
Him, and solemnly warned them against any 
that would spoil them, ending his introduc- 
tion by making the great central declarations 



Mutual Fulness 187 

of the epistle, that all the fulness of the God- 
head bodily dwells in Christ, and that the 
saints are made full in Him. 

In relation to Christ the believer stands in 
identification with His death, and with His 
resurrection. These facts are intimately con- 
nected with the glories of Christ dealt with in 
the earlier division of the letter. Union with 
the death of Christ means union with His pur- 
pose, that is, with His great work of recon- 
ciliation. Union with the resurrection of 
Christ means union with His Person, that is, 
with all the glories described. Thus, indeed, 
in Him the saints are made full, for they are 
reconciled through His death to the eternal 
order, and are equipped in His life for con- 
tinued harmony therewith. 

Immediately following this statement is a 
brief section dealing with the perils specially 
threatening the Church at Colossae. It is evi- 
dent that there were those who were attempt- 
ing to bring believers into bondage to external 
observances, and the apostle urged them that 
they should allow no man to judge them in 
these matters. The other peril was that of 
false intermediation, and the consequent wor- 
ship of angels, and he warned them against 
any such subservience, which is in itself false. 

Returning to his teaching concerning the 



188 Colossians 



identification of the believer with Christ, he 
showed the necessity for living in response 
to the twofold fact of union already dealt 
with. In view of identification with Christ in 
death, they were not to submit themselves to 
ordinances, because the whole fact of their re- 
lation to evil was conditioned within the fact 
of their death in Christ. 

Being through death set free from bondage 
to the commandments of men, believers are in 
life brought into captivity to the authority of 
Christ, and the things of Christ. They are 
therefore to seek the things above, that is to 
say, the aspiration, the desire, the passion of 
the life is to harmonize with that of Christ. 
They are moreover to set their mind on these 
things. Thus the life of the Christian in union 
with Christ has to do with the things above. 
They create the activity, "seek the things"; 
they condition the aspiration, "set your mind 
on the things"; they constitute the anticipa- 
tion, "Christ . . . shall be manifested . . . 
ye also." 

The apostle then proceeded to show how 
Christ is identified with His Church in all 
the relationships of its present life. This dis- 
cussion he introduced by a general statement 
as to responsibility. There must be answer to 
the fact of union in the putting to death of the 



Mutual Fulness 189 

things of the earth. Of these there are two 
lists given, one dealing with sensuality, and 
the other with bitterness of spirit. The in- 
junction to put these things to death is based 
upon the aflBirniation that they have put off 
the old man, and have put on the new. That 
which is a fact by faith, is to be made a fact 
in experience. 

The responsibility is not merely the nega- 
tive one, which consists in consent to identifi- 
cation in death; but also the positive one 
which consists of consent to identification in 
life. They are charged to put on all the things 
of the Christ life. They are moreover to let 
the peace of Christ rule, and the Word of 
Christ dwell in them. The final and inclusive 
word is "whatsoever ye do, in word or in deed, 
do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving 
thanks to God the Father through Him." 

This general statement of responsibility is 
followed by practical injunctions, all of which 
show how Christ is identified with His people 
for the activities of the present life. These 
deal with the relationships betweeji wives and 
husbands, children and fathers, servants and 
masters, all of them being set in the light of 
the supreme relationship to Christ. 

This division of the letter closes with a 
statement of three matters of supreme impor- 



190 Colossians 



tance in the life of the saint. The first has to 
do with prayer, which conditions the life in 
its relationship with God; the second has to 
do with the walk or behaviour of the believer ; 
the last deals with speech, these conditioning 
life toward those that are without. 

Conclusion 

The conclusion is local and personal. To the 
church at Colossse he recommended Tychicus 
and Onesimus, and sent messages from those 
who evidently were with him. It is interest- 
ing to notice three of these were Hebrews, and 
three were Gentiles. He then gave instruc- 
tions concerning his letters. The final words 
have in them a touch of pathos. Taking the 
pen from the one to whom he had been dictat- 
ing, he wrote words which indicate at once his 
sense of limitation, and his desire for sym- 
pathy, "Remember my bonds" ; and ended with 
the simple benediction.

I THESSALONIANS 

THE church at Thessalonica was founded 
amidst great and active opposition. The 
apostle being "sent away" by the brethren on 
account of the state of tumult existing in the 
city, went to Beraea and Athens, and on to 
Corinth, from whence this first letter was writ- 
ten. It is evident that the time elapsing be- 
tween his departure from Thessalonica and 
the writing of this epistle was very short, for 
he refers to "being bereaved of you for a sea- 
son of an hour." 

PauPs anxiety concerning the church in 
the midst of persecution had been so great that 
he had sent Timothy from Athens to find out 
their state. His return and report called 
forth this letter. These facts will help us to 
understand the nature of the epistle. It is 
intended to be a message of comfort and in- 
struction to those who are in the midst of 
persecution. The method is that of stating 
what the attitudes of Christian life really are, 
and thereby revealing the secrets of strength 
under such circumstances. The epistle may 
thus be analyzed : Introduction (i.) ; the Work 

1G3 



194 I Thessalonians 

of Faith, *'Ye turned" (ii.) ; the Labour of 
Love, "To serve" (iii.-iv. 12) ; the Patience of 
Hope, "To wait" (iv. 13-v. 22) ; Conclusion 

(v. 23-28). 

Introduction 

In the salutation the apostle associated with 
himself Silvanus and Timothy, the former 
having been with him at Thessalonica at the 
time of the founding of the church; and the 
latter having been a special messenger to 
them, upon whose report the letter was based. 

He then declared his thankfulness to God 
concerning them. The reason of this was his 
remembrance of three facts. These are the 
foundation-facts of Christian experience. The 
"work of faith" refers to belief of the Gospel ; 
the "labour of love" refers to the activity of 
life after belief ; the "patience of hope" refers 
to the attitude of waiting for the return of 
the Lord. The demonstration of the power of 
these facts he found in the memory of the way 
in which the Word came to them; in the fact 
that as the result of their reception of the 
Word they became imitators, and an en- 
sample; and that consequently from them the 
Gospel sounded forth. Having thus declared 
his thanksgiving, and stated its reason, and 
given demonstration of the reason, he de- 



Christ and His Advent 195 

Glared that these results in demonstration 
followed upon the fact that they "turned . . . 
to serve . . . and to wait." The connection 
between this threefold final statement and the 
threefold reason of thanksgiving is intimate. 
The "work of faith" consisted in turning "unto 
God from idols" ; the "labour of love" consists 
in serving "the living and the true God" ; and 
the "patience of hope" is constituted by wait- 
ing "for His Son from heaven." Around this 
threefold fact of their Christian experience 
the whole epistle circles. In each division all 
the facts are recognized, while only one has 
special treatment. 

A. The Work of Faith 

In this first division the apostle laid special 
emphasis on the "work of faith" which demon- 
strated his own spiritual authority, referring 
to their "labour of love" and their "patience 
of hope." 

It is evident that some of the Jews in Thes- 
salonica had been discounting the apostle in 
his absence. In answer to such detraction he 
first went back to the days when under great 
stress he preached to them and they believed, 
thus claiming that their work of faith, their 
turning from idols, was the supreme proof of 
the authority and power of his ministry. 



196 I Thessalonians 

Their Avork of faith was not ^'in vain." The 
ministry producing it was characterized by 
boldness, by faithfulness, by tenderness, and 
by earnestness. 

The demonstration of the apostle's au- 
thority was further emphasized by their 
"labour of love," the fact that they served the 
living and true God. Having received the 
Word, and worked the Avork of faith by the 
turning, they had treated it as the Word of 
God, and served even in suffering. Thus they 
had entered into fellowship with Him, and 
their fellow-believers in suffering. To serve 
the living and true God is a labour of love, 
that is to say, it is obedience to the law of 
love in the impulse of love, but it ever means 
more or less of suffering in the midst of those 
who are antagonistic to the revelation which 
God has made of His will through the Lord 
Jesus. 

He finally referred to the great subject of 
the Lord's return, thus encouraging them in 
that "patience of hope" which consists in 
waiting for His Son from heaven. Loving 
them with a great love, earnestly desiring to 
see them, he was yet hindered by Satan, and 
for his own comfort and for theirs, he re- 
minded them of that glorious hope of the 
Churchy the coming of the Lord Jesus, to 



Christ and His Advent 197 

which he looked forward for the one reward 
of all his toil, and pain, and suffering. That 
reward would consist in the presentation of 
these children of his ministry to Christ in the 
glory of His advent. 

B. The Labour of Love 

In this second division the apostle laid spe- 
cial emphasis upon the "labour of love," il- 
luminating the dark day by reference to the 
"patience of hope," and exhorting them to 
continue steadfastly in the "work of faith." 

Conscious of the strain under which the 
saints at Thessalonica were living, the apostle 
had sent Timothy to see how they fared, and 
he had brought a comforting report of their 
"faith" and "love." These words indicate two 
root-principles of the foundation-facts. Their 
work of turning from idols was the result 
of their faith. Their labour of serving the 
living God was the outcome of love. He thus 
rejoiced in that labour of love, which demon- 
strated the continuity of their work of faith. 

In view of their loyalty to service in the 
power of love, the apostle again referred to 
that great light of hope, the coming Lord. 
He breathed out an earnest prayer that his 
way might be directed to them, and that they 
might abound in love. The purpose of both 



198 I Thessalonians 

petitions was that their hearts might be "un- 
blamable in holiness ... at the coming of 
our Lord Jesus with all His saints.'' Thus in 
the midst of their suffering he flashed upon 
them the light of that glorious moment when 
character will be perfected, and the strain and 
stress of the process pass into the perfect satis- 
faction of the glorious results. 

He then turned to exhortation, urging his 
beloved children to be true to the attitudes 
of life assumed when they received the Word, 
and by the work of faith turned to God from 
idols. The first responsibility is that of per- 
sonal purity. He charged them that the will 
of God for them was their sanctification, and 
that they should be in possession of their own 
lives in obedience to God, under the dominion 
of the Holy Spirit. He next indicated the 
true attitude of the brethren towards each 
other, as being that of love, charging them to 
abound more and more therein. Finally, he 
wrote of their attitude toward those that are 
without, urging them to live the life of quiet 
and honest toil, thus creating a testimony to 
the power of the Gospel to those outside. 

c. The Patience of Hope 

In the third division the apostle dealt spe- 
cifically with the "patience of hope," showing 



Christ and His Advent 199 

that their relationship to the coming of the 
Lord was created by the "work of faith/' and 
again urging them to continuance in the "la- 
bour of love." 

It is evident that some of the Thessalonian 
Christians had fallen on sleep, and those re- 
maining were afraid that in some sense the de- 
parted ones had missed the realization of the 
glorious hope of the personal advent of Jesus. 
In order to correct that false impression the 
apostle dealt with the subject of the second 
advent in its relation to such as had fallen 
asleep. He first declared that these will take 
precedence of such as are alive at the advent, 
then in stately language he gave the pro- 
gramme of the advent, finally enjoining the 
sorrowing saints to comfort one another with 
these words. 

It is important to notice that the next sec- 
tion opens with the word "But." When we 
come to the second epistle we shall see that 
this message of the apostle was misunder- 
stood and misinterpreted, because a clear dis- 
tinction was not drawn between things which 
the apostle treated as separate. Having writ- 
ten to them of the coming of the Lord, he 
declared that he had no need to write to them 
of times and seasons, or of the day of the 
Lord; their work of faith had brought them 



200 I Thessalonians 

into the position of "sons of light," and there- 
fore they were to live in watchfulness and 
sobriety. The day of the Lord is to be a day 
of wrath. To it the saints are not appointed, 
but rather to salvation through our Lord 
Jesus Christ. Thus it is seen that the "work 
of faith," by which they turned from idols, 
is closely related to the "patience of hope," in 
which they waited for the Son. 

In view of this glorious certainty of hope, 
he finally urged them to continue in the "la- 
bour of love," which consists in serving the 
living and true God. This they were to do 
by submission to the spiritual teachers who 
admonished them in the light of the glorious 
consummation, also by carefulness concern- 
ing mutual relationships through the admon- 
ishing of the disorderly, the encouraging of 
the faint-hearted, the supporting of the weak, 
and long-suffering toward all. A series of 
general injunctions ends this section. 

Conclusion 

In conclusion the apostle made a final dec- 
laration of desire and assurance concerning 
these Thessalonian Christians. His desire 
was that they might be sanctified wholly by 
the "God of peace Himself." He evidently 
had no fear or doubt in his heart as to the 



Christ and His Advent 201 

issue, for he made the glorious declaration, 
"Faithful is He that calleth you, Who will 
also do if 

Words wholly personal follow. Conscious 
of the difficulties of his position at Corinth, 
he sought an interest in their prayers. The 
last words are those of most significant bene- 
diction, their faith and love and hope all cen- 
tred upon the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ. 
Through Him grace had been manifested for 
their salvation. In Him they stood in the 
grace which conditioned their service and 
their growth. At His coming the grace of the 
first epiphany would merge into the glory of 
the second. Thus the apostle in a benediction 
including faith and love and hope, committed 
them to the Lord Jesus Christ.

II THESSALONIANS 

THIS letter was evidently intended pri- 
marily to correct certain mistakes which 
the Thessalonians were making concerning 
the second advent; and thereby to strengthen 
them in the midst of their suffering, and recall 
some of them to devotion to present duty. 
Whether these mistakes arose from misinter- 
pretation of his first letter, or from the influ- 
ence of false teachers, is matter of small mo- 
ment. In all probability both these elements 
had contributed to the result. It would al- 
most seem as if some spurious letters, purport- 
ing to have come from the apostle, had been 
used in order to teach views of the second ad- 
vent which were untrue. 

The idea that the great day of the Lord, in 
which He would take vengeance on evil men, 
was approaching, was calculated to weaken 
their patience; and it had already rendered 
certain of them careless and unsettled in the 
matter of their daily calling. The letter, 
therefore, sets their tribulation in the light of 
the advent, by showing its true relation 

205 



206 II Thessalonians 

thereto; corrects mistakes concerning the or- 
der of the advent ; and urges them to devotion 
to duty. It may be divided thus: Introduc- 
tion (i. 1-5) ; Consolation (i. 6-12) ; Instruc- 
tion (ii. 1-12); Exhortation (ii. 13-iii. 15); 
Conclusion (iii. 16-18). 

Introduction 

Again the apostle associated Silvanus and 
Timothy with himself in the salutation. From 
this it would appear probable that the second 
letter followed the first quickly. The greet- 
ing is almost identical with that of the first. 
There is, however, the addition of the words 
"from God the Father and the Lord Jesus 
Christ^' which he almost invariably used in 
subsequent letters. 

He announced his thankfulness concerning 
them, giving a threefold reason — that of their 
present condition, the fact that they had been 
an argument for him, and the evidence of 
their patience. In dealing with their condi- 
tion he did not refer to their hope. The two 
foundation facts dealt with in the earlier 
epistle are recognized, but the third is not 
mentioned. There is the most intimate inter- 
relationship between faith, love, and hope. 
Whenever one of these, from any reason, is 
weakened, sooner or later the others languish. 



Christ and His Advent 207 

A. Consolation 

In order to the consolation of those who 
were troubled through misinterpretation of 
the truth of the second advent, the apostle 
first dealt with the subject of the revelation 
of the Lord Jesus, and then told them of his 
perpetual prayer for them. 

In dealing with the subject of the revelation 
he declared that it is to be for a definite pur- 
pose, that of vengeance. The connection of 
the saints with that apocalypse is, first, rest at 
the appearing; and finally, that they are to 
constitute the medium through which all His 
glory will be manifested and marvelled at in 
the succeeding ages. 

"To that end,'' that is with such a consum- 
mation in view, the apostle prayed that God 
might count them worthy of such calling, ful- 
filling every desire and good work ; the deepest 
desire of his heart being that at last in the 
fulness of inter-relation Christ may be glori- 
fied in them, and they in Christ. 

B. Instruction 

The apostle now made a clear statement of 
the order of events connected with the second 
advent of Jesus, in order to explain what he 
had already written, and to deliver them from 



208 II Thessalonians 

the confusion of ideas which was threatening 
to diminish their steadfastness by dimming 
their hope. He did this in two sections ; in the 
first of which he showed the distinction be- 
tween the coming, and the day; and in the 
second the relation between lawlessness and 
the Lord Jesus. 

For "the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ" 
they were to wait, for it is to be the occasion 
of the gathering of the saints to Himself. The 
day of the Lord is not "just at hand," nor can 
it come until certain other matters have been 
accomplished. He warned them against con- 
fusing the hope of the parousia of Jesus with 
the fact of His manifestation to men, whereby 
shall be ushered in the day of the Lord. 

Having thus referred to the day of the Lord, 
and to that revealing of the man of sin which 
is to precede it, the apostle described the pres- 
ent condition of affairs, and traced them to- 
ward the great crisis. Two forces are in con- 
flict, "the mystery of lawlessness," and the 
"One that restraineth." The former is at 
work like leaven, fermenting, corrupting, and 
the manifestations of its presence are every- 
where. The latter, as salt and light, prevents 
the spread of corruption, and utter darkness. 
This conflict is for a season. At the coming of 
Jesus the "One that restraineth" will be taken 



Christ and His Advent 209 

away, and "the mystery of lawlessness" will 
reveal itself in a person. In the day of the 
Lord, by the revelation of Jesus, the lawless 
one will be destroyed. 

c. Exhortation 

The last division is one pre-eminently of 
exhortation, in which he first described their 
position, and urged them to stand, then asked 
their prayer, and finally insisted upon the im- 
portance of work. 

They were chosen to salvation, that is, ul- 
timately, "to the obtaining of the glory of our 
Lord Jesus Christ." He charged them there- 
fore to stand fast, and hold the traditions. 
Thus he warned them against allowing any 
part of the foundation-truths at first declared 
to be forgotten, or to cease to have their proper 
influence upon their lives. 

The appeal to them to pray for him and his 
work reveals how his heart was burdened and 
exercised about the work at Corinth and in 
other cities. Again he affirmed his confidence 
in them, and expressed hope for their con- 
tinued patience. 

The last section of this division is emphatic 
to the verge of severity. The apostle was deal- 
ing with a material evidence of weakness, and 
his words ring with authority, and admit of no 



210 II Thessalonians 

possible manner of misconstruction. There 
were some in Thessalonica who were neglect- 
ing their lawful earthly calling, and had be- 
come chargeable to others, largely through 
misunderstanding of the doctrine of the 
second advent. This was wholly wrong, and 
contrary to the true meaning and intention of 
the hope of the advent. This the apostle urged 
upon their attention by the significant fact 
that, when he ministered the Word to them, 
he did not withdraw himself from the ordi- 
nary avocation of his daily life. The matter 
was so serious that he charged those who were 
loyal to withdraw themselves from those who 
walked disorderly. In further enforcement 
the apostle laid down a great principle of life. 
"If any man will not work, neither let him 
eat." This is drastic and final. Any view of 
the advent, or, indeed, any view of life, which 
makes work distasteful, and causes its neglect, 
ought to, and must stay all food supplies. 
Again he charged them that, if any man dis- 
regarded these injunctions, they were to have 
no company with him. 

Conclusion 

The letter closes with words of tender de> 
sire on their behalf. He did not forget their 
troublous circumstances, and supremely de- 



Christ and His Advent 211 

sired peace for them. Peace, however, for him, 
was only associated with the Lordship of 
Jesus, Whom he here spoke of as "the Lord of 
Peace," and Whose presence will assure them 
that blessing. 

A personal salutation, and the apostle's 
declaration that his signature is guarantee of 
the genuineness of his writing, was for their 
safeguarding against spurious communica- 
tions, such as had caused them trouble in the 
matter of the advent. 

There is the addition of one little word to 
the final benediction as compared with its 
form in the first epistle. It is the word "all." 
Does not the apostle here take in the disor- 
derly as well, and so reveal the greatness of 
his heart and love for them?

I TIMOTHY 

THE subject of PauPs association with 
Timothy is very full of interest, and of 
beauty. It is the story of a sacred and beau- 
tiful comradeship in Christ between an old 
and a young man. The apostle's references 
to Eunice and Lois would suggest a long ac- 
quaintance with them ; and from the fact that 
Lystra is not far from Tarsus it has been con- 
jectured that these women had been influenced 
by the apostle during the early days of his 
Christian life in which he lived there, before 
Barnabas sought him and brought him to An- 
tioch. The first recorded visit to Lystra ended 
in the terrible stoning of the apostle, when he 
seemed to be dead. Almost immediately he 
returned to confirm the disciples. In all prob- 
ability the boy Timothy was led to Christ 
then, for Paul speaks of him as his son in the 
faith, and on the occasion of his next visit 
Timothy is a disciple, "well reported of by 
the brethren." 

It was at this time that the apostle officially 
set him apart to the work of the ministry, and 
from that time onward he shared his journey- 

215 



216 I Timothy 



ings and helped him in his work. Near the 
end of the life of Paul, certain conditions ob- 
taining in the church at Ephesus made it 
necessary that some one should be stationed 
there, having apostolic authority to set things 
in order. To this work Timothy was assigned. 
PauFs supreme passion was ever that of the 
well-being of tlie Church as "the pillar and 
ground of the truth," and he parted from 
Timothy, sacrificing his own personal comfort, 
as many tender touches reveal, in order that 
the church at Ephesus might be cared for. 

This epistle was sent to Timothy at 
Ephesus, and contains such instructions as are 
necessary to fit him for the work he has to do. 
It may broadly be divided thus; Introduction 
(i. 1, 2); Timothy's Charge, the Church (i. 
3-iii. 16) ; Charge to Timothy, the Ministry 
(iv.-vi. 16); Conclusion (vi. 17-21). 

Introduction 

In the apostolic salutation two elements are 
revealed which characterize the whole epistle, 
those namely of authority and tenderness. 
PauPs introduction of himself is a declaration 
of authority. In order to the proper govern- 
ment of the church there must be duly con- 
stituted authority, and this is traced and set 
in its true relation. Paul's greeting to 



Christ and His Minister 217 

Timothy is a revelation of tenderness in his 
form of address, "My true child in faith"; 
and in the words of actual salutation, "Grace, 
mercy, peace.'^ 

A. TiMOTHY^s Charge. The Church 

Through all the personal and local values of 
this section there may be discovered the apos- 
tolic conceptions of the Church itself, and 
these constitute the bases of interpretation. 
The apostle first had in mind the Church and 
man, her Gospel; then the Church and God, 
her intercession; finally the Church herself, 
her office and officers. 

The Church's Gospel is the Gospel of "the 
blessed God," and therefore Timothy is to safe- 
guard it against any different doctrine. The 
law is good, but it is for the lawless. All the 
things of evil, against which it protests, are 
absent in the lives of those obedient to sound 
doctrine. The power of the Gospel is illus- 
trated by an experimental passage in which 
he confessed the sin of the past, triumphed in 
the grace which overcame it, and claimed the 
service resulting. All ended in a great song 
of praise. Timothy is charged to "war the 
good warfare," which means a great deal 
more than fighting the good fight of faith 
in personal life. The words convey the 



218 I Timothy 



thought of a campaign, and include all the 
responsibilities of the officer in command. He 
is to engage in the warfare, remembering 
the prophecies uttered concerning him, and 
holding faith in a good conscience. The 
apostle emphasized the urgency of his charge 
by words of warning, in which he cited in- 
stances of those who had failed. 

The Church is not only called to proclaim to 
men the evangel of God, but to plead with 
God the cause of men. The apostle exhorted 
to the exercise of this function, which he de- 
scribed by the use of words covering the whole 
ground, "supplications, prayers, intercessions, 
thanksgivings.'' He then named the subjects 
of prayer, declared its warrant, and insisted 
that those who prayed should be clean in con- 
duct, and strong in character. The subject of 
the public assemblies of the church in Ephesus 
was evidently in the mind of the apostle as he 
described the demeanour and position of 
women. 

In order to the proclamation of the evangel, 
and the exercise of intercession, the church it- 
self must be properly governed, and recognize 
the true meaning of her existence. Turning 
to the subject of government, the apostle dealt 
with two orders, bishops and deacons. The 
bishop is an overseer — that is, one whose duty 



Christ and His Minister 219 

it is to watch over the flock, and know them, 
to become acquainted with their condition and 
their needs. After declaring the excellence of 
the office, he proceeded to describe the qualifi- 
cations necessary for its fulfilment. The pic- 
ture is that of a perfectly balanced life, 
neither given to excess in any direction, nor 
ascetic. The office of the deacon was not in- 
ferior, but different. It was complementary 
and co-operative. In a description of the 
qualifications therefore for this work the apos- 
tle was as careful as when dealing with the 
calling of the bishop. He also recognized the 
possible necessity of appointing women to the 
office, under certain circumstances; and in a 
few words defined their qualifications, show- 
ing them to be practically the same as those 
for men. 

AH this leads to the final declaration of this 
first division, which is a remarkable and sin- 
gularly beautiful description of the Church 
and her purpose. She is the house of God, and 
moreover, the pillar and ground of the truth — 
that is, the institution which upholds and 
manifests truth in the sight of all. This led 
the apostle further, and he declared what that 
truth was which the Church supports and re- 
veals. 



220 I Timothy 



B. Charge to Timothy. The Ministry 

Having thus dealt with the Church as the 
charge committed to Timothy, the apostle 
charged Timothy as to how he was to fulfil his 
responsibility; and dealt with his duty toward 
the truth, his duty toAvard his flock, and his 
duty toward himself. 

With regard to the first, Paul first definitely 
and solemnly warned him of an approaching 
danger. There would be a decline in faith 
consequent upon ascetic practices. The cor- 
rective consists in a declaration of the breadth 
of true godliness, which takes in life as a 
whole; both in its present and future realiza- 
tions. Godliness does not starve any life, 
does not produce any crippling of the powers, 
has nothing to do with limitation. The 
secrets of strength for those who are called 
upon to defend the truth against error are 
next set forth. Hope is to be set on God. The 
teacher must be such a man as to carry con- 
viction and command respect. In order to 
this, he must give himself to reading, exhorta- 
tion, teaching, which words here undoubtedly 
all refer to the public work, and their com- 
bination suggests the true type of preaching. 
Again, in order to such public ministry there 
must be the cultivation of the gift, and then 



Christ and His Minister 221 

earnest devotion to the things to be declared. 
This is expressed in the charge, "give thyself 
wholly to them." No man gifted for the min- 
istry can afford to devote himself, giving part 
of his strength of body or of mind, to other 
things. So sacred and so spacious is the glori- 
ous work, that it demands the whole man. 
The general attitude therefore is expressed in 
the language, "Take heed to thyself, and to 
thy teaching." That is the duty of the 
preacher to truth, first the answer of his own 
life to its claims, and then the teaching of it 
to others. 

The next section deals with the duty of the 
minister to his flock. His demeanour toward 
men and women is described. The large sec- 
tion devoted to widows indicates the local con- 
ditions and dangers. Elders in the church 
are to be held in honour, and provided for. 
If an elder is found guilty of sin, his public 
position demands public reproof, for the sake 
of the maintenance of a general discipline. 
The responsibility in this connection is so 
great that the apostle solemnly charged Tim- 
othy as to how he is to act in the light of God, 
of Jesus Christ, and the elect angels. At this 
point in the letter there occurs a personal pa- 
renthesis ; in all probability on a subject occur- 
ring to his mind at the moment, and dealt with 



222 I Timothy 



immediately lest it should be forgotten. The 
last injunction of the apostle concerning Tim- 
othy's duty toward his flock indicated the line 
of his teaching of those Christian slaves who 
were members thereof. Those who serve un- 
believing masters are to let their service be a 
testimony to the profession they make. Those 
who serve Christian masters are not to pre- 
sume upon their spiritual relation to such as 
a reason for the neglect of duty. They are 
rather to serve all the more zealously, out of 
love and respect. 

The apostle now reverted to the prime occa- 
sion of Timothy's appointment to Ephesus, 
that namely of the false teachers. His refer- 
ence to this consisted of a scathing description 
of them, and a startling revelation of the real 
reason of their action. This prepared the 
way for his dealing with Timothy's duty to- 
ward himself. The apostolic form of address 
here recognized the character of Timothy, "O 
man of God." His charge to him was three- 
fold: he was to flee, to follow, to fight. The 
young ambassador of the Cross is placed be- 
tween the sad and sorrowful Jesus testifying 
to truth in the court of the Roman governor, 
and the glorious Person of the manifested 
King at the day of His advent. 



Christ and His Minister 223 

Conclusion 

The conclusion seems to be of the nature of 
a postscript. The final charge to Timothy had 
brought to the mind of the apostle the perils 
which threatened all those who were rich in 
this world, and for their sakes he described 
the true attitude of a Christian man. The 
letter closes in an outburst of personal appeal 
which seems to gather within itself all the 
varied tones of what had already been written 
— personal tenderness, apostolic authority, a 
great sense of wrong being done to truth, and 
consequent anger, with tremendous urgency 
in the special charge. Positive responsibility 
is that he guard the deposit ; and negative that 
he turn away from the things which oppose. 
The brief final benediction is full of comfort. 
For such responsibilities as rested upon this 
man, how much was needed of the full grace of 
God; and there need be no anxiety, no panic, 
for that grace is ever the portion of such as 
are appointed to responsibility.

II TIMOTHY 

THIS second letter to Timothy was also 
written from prison, and in all likeli- 
hood followed the first within a very few 
months. It is evidently a sequel to it. The 
troubles in the church were the same as those 
referred to before, and the charge to Timothy 
was of the same kind. The note of apostolic 
urgency seems to be accentuated. It is evi- 
dent tliat Paul wrote again under a threefold 
con ^cioiisness. He was conscious of his own 
approaching departure. He recognized the 
evil existing in the church at Ephesus, and 
forecast the terrible days that are coming. 
He was, moreover, most acutely conscious of 
the grave responsibility resting on Timothy. 
In the light of the first two facts — his de- 
parture and the evil days at hand — he ad- 
dressed himself to Timothy concerning his 
responsibility. 

The epistle is consequently almost exclu- 
sively personal. His heart was set on this 
child of his own labour with solicitous 
anxiety, that he in turn might be faithful to 

227 



228 II Timothy 



his opportunity, both for his own sake, and 
for the sake of the truth. 

The letter is intensely interesting as the last 
of PauPs writings, and as revealing the true 
attitude of the minister in days of declension 
and peril. The letter may be divided thus; 
Introduction (i. 1-5), Personal Responsibility 
(i. 6-ii. 13) ; Church Responsibility (ii. 14-iii. 
13) ; Truth Responsibility (iii. 14-iv. 5) ; Con- 
clusion (iv. 6-22). 

Introduction 

In this introduction there are two phrases 
differing from those used in the first letter. 
He described his apostleship as being "accord- 
ing to the promise of the life which is in Christ 
Jesus." This is particularly suited to this 
letter, which was intended to strengthen Tim- 
othy in view of his difl&cult work. He called 
Timothy his beloved child, and thus expressed 
a growing tenderness for him. The passage 
of thanksgiving breathes the very spirit of this 
affection. 

A. Personal Responsibility 

The subject of Timothy's personal responsi- 
bility the apostle dealt with first as to gifts, 
and secondly as to grace. 

He first laid two injunctions upon him to 
"stir up the gift," and not to be ashamed of 



Christ and His Minister 229 

the testimony. The gift bestowed upon him 
was that of capacity for oversight, and was 
characterized by power, love, and discipline. 
This twofold injunction is emphasized by a 
twofold incentive, that namely of the great- 
ness of the Gospel committed as a deposit, and 
of PauFs experience and convictions in rela- 
tion to the responsibility of the ministry. The 
discussion of these is followed by an injunc- 
tion, including a question of government and 
courage, and the paragraph ends with exam- 
ples of those who failed, and of one who has 
been true. 

Continuing, the apostle came to the subject 
of grace, and again there are two injunctions, 
"Be strengthened in the grace," "suffer hard- 
ship,'^ the latter being illustrated by the sol- 
dier who is loyal to a king, the athlete who 
observes the conditions, and the husbandman 
who labours and waits. Here again the apos- 
tle passed from injunctions to incentives, and 
the first is expressed in the comprehensive 
words, "Remember Jesus Christ." This com- 
mand recognized the limitations of human 
life, and called to definite acts and seasons of 
meditation. The apostle then passed to a 
lower level of incentive, that of his own ex- 
perience, yet this would have special weight 
with Timothy, the child of his love. Paul's 



230 II Timothy 



suffering is declared in the words^ "I suffer 
hardship unto bonds, as a malefactor/' His 
confidence flames out in the declaration, "The 
word of God is not bound." Turning finally 
from the supreme example of Jesus, and his 
own corroborative evidence of the possibility 
of triumph in service over suffering, the apos- 
tle quoted one "faithful saying," which at 
once set the principles of responsibility clearly 
before the mind. The foundation principle is 
that of identification with Jesus in death and 
resurrection, and the whole experience of 
Christian service is described in the words, "If 
we endure, we shall also reign with Him." 
To understand these things is to feel the force 
of the warnings, "If we shall deny Him, He 
also will deny us." 

B. Church Responsibility 

In charging Timothy as to his responsibility 
concerning the church, the apostle dealt with 
the perils and duties then present, and with 
the coming troubles. 

His first duty to the church was that of the 
exercise of his gift, and the apostle's instruc- 
tion gathered round the threefold thought con- 
tained in the description of the spirit of the 
gift already stated. Placing the workman 
into contrast with the destroyers, he was to 



Christ and His Minister 231 

exercise power. This exercise was made 
necessary by the presence of those who were 
disputing about words, and indulging in "pro- 
fane babblings." He was, moreover, to exer- 
cise his gift in the spirit of love, but in the 
definite administration of discipline. In 
order to all this he must himself flee aspira- 
tions and desires which are self-centred, follow 
the truth, and refuse questions likely to en- 
gender strife. 

The apostle then turned aside to give Tim- 
othy a distinct foretelling of coming trouble. 
Even more trying times would come than 
those in the midst of which Timothy was then 
exercising his ministry, days characterized by 
"holding a form of godliness, but having 
denied the power thereof." In view of these 
coming troubles the apostle wrote of his own 
manner of life in order to prepare Timothy. 
He had passed through all manner of suffer- 
ing, but always, through the strength and 
faithfulness of his Lord, unto victory. 

c. Truth Responsibility 

Paul now turned to the question of Tim- 
othy's responsibility concerning the truth, 
dealing first with the Scriptures themselves, 
and then uttering his final charge. One word 
indicates the personal responsibility, and that 



282 II Timothy 



is "abide." The words which indicate the 
values of the Scriptures are evidently care- 
fully chosen: "teaching, reproof, correction, 
instruction." Their purpose is the making 
complete of the man of God in order that he 
may be prepared for his work. 

His final charge had to do first with his 
work. The incentives are those of the final 
testing, and the very perils in the midst of 
which he laboured. His work is stated in four 
words, "preach, reprove, rebuke, exhort," 
which exactly correspond to the values of the 
Scriptures already declared. Moreover, the 
measure in which he will be able to use the 
Word influentially for the edification of 
others, is the measure in which he himself is 
established in character and conduct thereby. 

Conclusion 

In this conclusion we have in all probability 
the last written words of Paul preserved to us, 
and they declare his own final attitude as to 
his own ministry, as to his associates, as to 
his enemies. The final salutations are fol- 
lowed by the words "grace be with you." The 
one great theme of all Paul's preaching and 
teaching had been that of grace, and therefore 
this brief sentence forms a most fitting con- 
clusion to the things he has written.

TITUS 

IT is a remarkable fact that Titus is not 
mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles. 
All we know of him we gather from the writ- 
ings of Paul. From the present letter we 
learn that he was a convert of the apostle. 
From the letter to the Galatians we learn that 
he was a Greek. In the second letter to the 
Corinthians there are sundry references to 
him. He met Paul in Macedonia, and gave 
him an account of the effect produced by his 
first letter to Corinth. He voluntarily under- 
took the completing of the collections for the 
saints at Jerusalem. Paul speaks of him as a 
partner and fellow-worker. He was sent to 
Corinth to make collections for the poor saints 
at Jerusalem. Finally, Paul declares his con- 
fidence in him. 

The present epistle finds him in Crete for a 
temporary sojourn, having a definite purpose. 
His stay there was to be short. There is un- 
certainty as to the foundation of the churches 
in Crete. Most probably they were the direct 
results of the day of Pentecost. Christian 

235 



286 Titus 

doctrine had been corrupted by Judaizing 
teachers. This, taken together with the 
natural characteristics of the Cretans, had 
brought about a state of disorder. Titus was 
sent to set things in order, and this letter con- 
tains his instructions. The epistle may be 
divided in the following way; Introduction (i. 
1-4) ; Church Government (i. 5-16) ; Church 
Behaviour (ii.) ; Church and State (iii. 1-11) ; 
Conclusion (iii. 12-15). 

Introduction 

Paul described himself first by the funda- 
mental and inclusive truth, as the "bond- 
servant of God.'' His definition of apostleship 
follows, and is full and remarkable. He was 
an apostle "according to the faith of God's 
elect," that is to say, all his ministry was ex- 
ercised within the limits of that faith. Its 
strength is indicated in the words, "in hope 
of eternal life." His salutation of Titus as 
"my true child after a common faith" suggests 
relationship in that which conditioned the re- 
lationship and apostleship of Paul. 

A. Church Government 

The chief business of Titus in Crete was 
that of setting the church in order, and the 



Christ and His Minister 237 

apostle first discussed the true form of govern- 
ment as to its office, its functions, its char- 
acter. 

The office is that of the elder, which is coin- 
cident with that of the bishop. The function 
of the elder is declared to be that of a steward, 
which suggests general oversight, and manage- 
ment of the affairs of the household. The ful- 
filment of this will be realized by a recogni- 
tion of the fact that he is a teacher. The func- 
tion of the bishop, therefore, is not that of 
making laws and regulations, but that of in- 
terpreting the will of God as revealed in the 
sound doctrine, and insisting upon obedience. 
Only men of character are to be appointed to 
such office, and the apostle described the char- 
acter as that of a threefold blamelessness. 
The bishop must be blameless in family life, 
blameless personally, blameless in doctrine. 

The immediate reason for the work of Titus 
in Crete was that of the presence there of 
Judaizing teachers, who for fifthy lucre's sake 
were perverting the truth, and working havoc 
in whole houses. His method, therefore, 
would necessarily be that of severity. He was 
to reprove them sharply. The reason of the 
severity, however, is here, as always, that the 
highest purposes of love may be realized. 



238 Titus 



B. Church Behaviour 

In showing what the behaviour of the 
Church of God should be, the apostle first laid 
down particular precepts, and then declared 
the power in which it would be possible to 
obey. The behaviour is to be such as befits 
sound doctrine, and he made application of 
this to the aged men and aged women, to the 
young women and young men, and finally to 
servants. It was of these last that he de- 
clared, "that they may adorn the doctrine of 
God our Saviour in all things," thus revealing 
the fact that the more difficult the circum- 
stances in which Christian life is to be lived, 
the greater is the opportunity for revealing to 
the world the graciousness and glory of the 
government. 

If these are the commandments laid upon 
the members of the Church, he proceeded to 
show that it is possible to obey them because 
of the resources at the disposal of every Chris- 
tian. In a passage of singular beauty and 
power he declared the fourfold value of the 
grace of God. That grace had its epiphany at 
the first advent of Jesus. It first brings sal- 
vation; then teaches; next through the result 
produced by teaching, denies ungodliness and 
worldly lusts; and throughout all these it 



Christ and His Minister 239 

directs the eyes of the saint toward the advent 
of glory. Thus the two advents are referred 
to. The first was the occasion of the epiphany 
of grace. The second will be the occasion of 
the epiphany of glory. In order to obey the 
precepts it is necessary to live in the light of 
the twofold relation to the advent of grace and 
the advent of glory. This description of the 
power of grace merges into a statement con- 
cerning the work of Christ through which the 
grace of God has become operative in the need 
of man. 

c. Church and State 

The final division, called forth by local cir- 
cumstances, nevertheless clearly reveals the 
apostle's conception of the relation between 
Church and State. This he dealt with by de- 
claring the Church's duty, the Church's im- 
pulse, and showing the method of realiza- 
tion. 

The duty of the Church is first that of sub- 
jection to the authorities, secondly readiness 
to every good work, thirdly freedom from all 
evil speech, and finally the maintenance to- 
ward all men of the attitude of gentleness and 
meekness. The presence of such persons in 
any State is a positive benefit conferred. 
The multiplication of such lives serves to 



240 Titus 

strengthen and establish the life and order 
of any nation. 

There are certain facts which, being remem- 
bered, will contribute to the fulfilment of these 
ideals of life and conduct, in relation to the 
State. The first is that they should remember 
their own past ; the second is that they should 
remember the Divine grace whereby the 
change has been wrought in them ; and finally, 
they should recognize what is the value of 
their present position of life. This threefold 
memory of what we were, of how the change 
has been wrought, and of what we are, will 
serve ever to create the spirit of subjection to 
authority, when that authority does not con- 
flict with submission to the will of God, will 
equip us for all honesty of toil, will silence all 
evil speech, and will generate an unceasing 
passion toward those that are without. 

For the realization of these ideals of life 
by the local church Titus, as appointed to 
oversight, is held responsible. He is to fulfil 
his office as steward of God by the declaration 
of that which is profitable, by the shunning of 
all that is unprofitable, and by the persistent 
maintenance of discipline. 



Christ and His Minister 241 

Conclusion 

The conclusion of this epistle shows that it 
was written at an earlier date than that to 
Timothy, for the apostle was evidently at lib- 
erty, and choosing his own place of winter 
residence. He then dealt with matters of 
local significance, and closed with a benedic- 
tion which harmonizes with his opening salu- 
tation. For the fulfilment of his work as 
steward of the house of God, and for the 
Church's submission to his direction, grace is 
needed and supplied.

PHILEMON 

THIS letter is of a purely personal nature. 
Its right to a place in the canon was 
called in question in the fourth century on the 
ground that its manner and content were be- 
neath the dignity of the apostle. This opin- 
ion was surely the result of superficial exam- 
ination, as, while it is perfectly true that the 
matter dealt with is of a personal and private 
nature, yet the whole method of dealing with 
it is a radiant revelation of the application of 
Christian principle to matters of individual 
life and social relationship. 

After the introduction (vers. 1-3) the letter 
falls into three divisions; the Approach (vers. 
4-7) ; the Argument (vers. 8-16) ; the Appeal 
(vers. 17-21) ; with a Conclusion (vers. 22-25). 

Introduction 

While the letter is addressed to Philemon, 
the apostle includes the members of his house- 
hold, and the whole Church. The reason for 
this is, evidently, that upon the new social re- 
lationships existing among the members of the 

245 



246 Philemon 



Christian Church, Paul is about to base his 
appeal on behalf of Onesimus. 

A. The Approach 

After the usual salutation of grace and 
peace the apostle proceeded to declare his 
thankfulness for all he heard of the love and 
faith of Philemon. It is to be carefully noted 
that this love and faith was described as being 
"toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the 
saints." He prayed for him that the fellow- 
ship of his faith might be effectual, and de- 
clared how much joy and comfort he had in 
the knowledge of the fact that the saints had 
been refreshed by Philemon. All this consti- 
tuted a method of approach to the argument 
upon which he based the specific appeal which 
was the principal purpose of the writing of 
the letter. 

B. The Argument 

The first movement in the apostle's argu- 
ment was that of the introduction of himself. 
He declared that although he had full author- 
ity to command Philemon as to what befitted 
his profession of Christianity, he did not 
choose to do so. He chose rather to appeal 
to him upon the basis of his love. Setting 
aside his oflficial authority, he set up the 



Christ and Social Relationships 247 

authority of their mutual love. Very tender, 
and full of the most sacred art, was his refer- 
ence to himself as "the aged," and "a prisoner 
of Jesus Christ." It would have been very 
difficult for Philemon to have refused com- 
pliance with anything requested by one who 
was so highly esteemed and tenderly loved in 
the faith, especially in view of the fact that 
he was bowed beneath the weight of years, ap- 
proaching the end of his life and ministry, and 
withal a prisoner bound in chains for the sake 
of the Gospel. Thus the apostle would cap- 
ture him by this introduction of himself. 

He then adopted a new method of argu- 
ment by the way in which he referred to Onesi- 
mus. This man, a slave of Philemon, had run 
away from his master, and the most probable 
attitude of Philemon toward him would be 
that of a perfectly just anger. Of course, in 
reading this story the men must be measured 
by the standards of their own age. The more 
perfect light in which we are now living, and 
which makes the holding of slaves impossible, 
was then only beginning to break through the 
darkness, and its meaning was not perfectly 
apprehended. Therefore it was that Paul in- 
troduced the name of the runaway in the way 
in which he did, referring to him as "my child, 
whom I have begotten in my bonds." From 



248 Philemon 



these words it is evident that in some way 
Onesimus had come under the influence of 
Paul, and had been brought to Christ thereby. 
Reference to his relationship to Philemon im- 
mediately followed, but was introduced with 
a touch of playful humour ; for the word Ones- 
imus means profitable, and when the apostle 
wrote, "who once was unprofitable to thee, 
but now is profitable to thee and me," he was 
indulging in a play upon words. 

c. The Appeal 

At last the apostle reached the appeal. He 
asked Philemon to receive Onesimus as though 
he were receiving Paul himself. Seeing that 
there might be some difficulty in the way, the 
apostle made himself responsible for any debt 
which Onesimus owed Philemon, gently re- 
minding the latter that he owed himself to 
Paul. He finally declared his confidence that 
Philemon would do as he asked, and even be- 
yond. 

Conclusion 

Finally, the apostle expressed his hope that 
he would be able to visit Philemon ; requested 
that a lodging should be prepared for him; 
sent salutations ; and pronounced the benedic- 
tion.

HEBREWS 

THERE is great uncertainty as to the 
authorship of this treatise. Into the 
discussion we do not propose to enter. Its 
main subject is that of the superiority of the 
revelation of God in Christ to all that had pre- 
ceded it. This is dealt with in order that the 
faith of Hebrew Christians may be estab- 
lished. For the strengthening of that faith 
the writer laid bare the foundations, and de- 
scribed the fruitfulness. Its purpose is to 
show the hopelessness of those guilty of apos- 
tasy from Christ, by revealing the perfection 
and finality of His message and work. The 
broad divisions are; Introduction (i. l-2a) ; 
The Argument, Foundations of Faith (i. 2b-x. 
37) ; the Appeal, Fruitfulness of Faith (x. 38- 
xii.) ; Conclusion (xiiL). 

Introduction 

The introduction takes us at once to the 
heart of the subject, and declares in compact 
form the truth upon which all the subsequent 
arguments and appeals depend. Two truths 
are taken for granted — the existence of God, 

251 



252 Hebrews 



and the fact that He reveals Himself to men. 
Two periods of revelation are referred to in 
the phrases, "of old time," and "at the end of 
these days." 

A. The Argument. Foundations of Faith 

The first division of the book is devoted to 
the argument which sets forth the superiority 
of the speech of the Son "at the end of these 
days," to all that had been spoken, "of old 
time"; and claims the superiority of conse- 
quent relationships. 

After the declaration that God now speaks 
in the Son there follows a sevenfold descrip- 
tion of the glories of the Son, which perfectly 
includes all the economies of the past. In 
Him all voices merge into the one Voice, all 
signs are fulfilled in the one Manifestation, all 
visions shine through the essential Light. 
Thus emphasis is laid upon the authority and 
finality of the Christian revelation, and the 
absolute safety of the same as the groundwork 
of faith. 

Then follows the detailed argument for the 
superiority of the Son to all the methods of 
the past. The Hebrews believed that their 
system was ministered by angels, and so was 
supernatural. The subject of the superiority 
of the Son to the angels is introduced by 



Christ the Final Speech of God 253 

seven quotations from Old Testament Scrip- 
tures. The first two show the superiority of 
the Son in the matter of relationship to God. 
The third claims the worship of the angels for 
the Son. The fourth, fifth, and sixth contrast 
the service of the angels with the supremacy 
of the Son. The seventh shows the superior- 
ity of the Son Who shares the Throne over 
those who are its ministers. 

The epistle is characterized by occasional 
applications and solemn warnings. While the 
w^riter specially devotes himself to such state- 
ments concerning the foundations of faith as 
shall strengthen faith, he is careful to make 
such deductions as will reveal the peril of 
apostasy. The first of these warnings argues 
that if the ministration of angels had been of 
so stedfast a character, how much more the 
speech of the Son. 

Continuing the argument concerning the 
superiority of the Son to the angels, the writer 
introduces a new statement. He Who in es- 
sential nature was superior to them, yet for a 
period was made lower. Through His humili- 
ation and the victory wrought therein. He 
passed back to the place of superiority, carry- 
ing with Him a new right of supremacy over 
man, to whose level He passed in humiliation. 

The argument now passes to the second 



254 Hebrews 



claim of superiority, that over human leaders. 
It includes in its process the superiority of the 
Son to Moses and Joshua, the man who led the 
people out, and the man who led the people 
in. It first institutes a comparison between 
Moses and Christ. Christ is the Son over the 
spiritual house, of which the tabernacle was 
but the shadow, in which Moses was a servant. 
The contrast is striking, and the argument in- 
tended is, that if faith centred on the pattern 
and the men who built it, how much more may 
it confidently take hold upon the One Who 
in His own Person fulfils all that was shad- 
owed forth by the servant of old, and by the 
pattern house in which he served. 

Then follows the second exhortation and 
warning. Readers are reminded of what hap- 
pened in the wilderness. The heart was hard- 
ened by unbelief, God was displeased, and they 
were shut out from rest. The whole force of 
the illustration is that of reminding those to 
whom the letter is addressed that if in the 
case of unbelief in the servant, men were shut 
out from rest, much more will that be true in 
the case of those who are disobedient to the 
Son. The reason why a generation perished 
in the wilderness is declared to be that "the 
word of hearing did not profit them, because 
it was not united by faith with them that 



Christ the Final Speech of God 255 

heard." Notwithstanding the fact of this past 
failure the offer is repeated, this time, how- 
ever, hy the superior speech of the Son. All 
this gives urgency to the appeal with which 
the section opened, "Let us fear, therefore, 
lest haply a promise being left of entering into 
His rest, any one of you should seem to have 
come short of it." 

In close connection, because the subject is 
virtually the same, the writer deals with the 
superiority of the Son over Joshua. Joshua 
completed that in human leadership, in which 
Moses failed. He led the people in. Yet 
while it is true that he led them into the land, 
he did not lead them into rest. What he failed 
to do, the Son accomplished; and this is re- 
ferred to by the writer in the words, "He that 
is entered into His rest hath himself also 
rested from his works as God did from His." 

The section showing the superiority of the 
Son to the leaders closes with an inclusive ex- 
hortation and w^arning, descriptive of the 
power of the Word of God. 

The waiter now passes to discuss the superi- 
ority of Christ as Priest. He first makes a 
statement of the fact of His priesthood, which 
he accompanies by appeals. Because Jesus, 
the Son of God, is a great High Priest, the 
appeal is made, "Let us hold fast our confes- 



256 Hebrews 



sion.'' Because of the nature of His priest- 
hood, the appeal is made, "Let us therefore 
draw near/^ Then commences the argument 
by contrast. The two essential qualifications 
for a priest are a capacity for sympathy, and 
a vocation of God. These are fulfilled in 
Christ, as they never were in Aaron. 

Having thus introduced the subject, the 
writer declares his sense of difficulty in deal- 
ing with it, because of the incapacity of the 
readers; and he appeals to them to leave the 
first principles, and press on to perfection; 
again in solemn and awful words warning 
them against apostasy. 

Turning to the subject of the superiority of 
the priesthood of the Son to the Levitic, the 
writer commences by taking his readers back 
in thought to Abraham, whose anchorage was 
the oath of God, which oath is ratified in the 
Person of our High Priest, Whose priesthood 
was after the order of Melchisedec. He then 
shows the superiority of the Melchisedec 
priesthood to the Levitic. The whole Levitic 
priesthood paid tithes to Melchisedec in the 
person of Abraham, from whose loins they 
sprang. Thus the living Priest received tithes 
from the dying, even while they were yet un- 
born, and He blessed them in the person of 
Abraham. Therefore it is evident that the 



Christ the Final Speech of God 257 

Levitic priesthood is inferior to that of Mel- 
chisedec; and the priesthood of the Son is 
after the pattern of that of Melchisedec. In 
the next place he shows the inferiority of the 
Levitic priesthood in that it was unequal to 
the realization of perfection; and the superi- 
ority of the priesthood of Jesus is revealed in 
the fact that through Him a better hope has 
been given to men through which they draw 
nigh unto God, and perfection is realized. 

The contrast is finally made vivid in two 
particulars, first, as to the oath of appoint- 
ment ; and second, as to the perpetuity of the 
office. These contrasts are marked by two 
phrases, each occurring twice, "they indeed," 
"but He." The High Priest is described 
finally as to character, "holy, guileless, unde- 
filed, separated from sinners"; as to position, 
"made higher than the heavens;" as to medi- 
atorial rights, the sacrifice of Himself once 
for all. 

Having established the fact of the superior- 
ity of Christ, the argument now proceeds to 
deal with the superiority of the relationships 
consequent thereupon. The superiority of the 
Priest demonstrates the superiority of the 
place of the exercise of the priesthood, and 
thus finally demonstrates the superiority of 
the covenant. That superiority is threefold. 



258 Hebrews 



It is internal rather than external; it is uni- 
versal rather than local; and finally it is 
based upon the forgiveness of sins. 

Upon the basis of the better priesthood and 
the better covenant there issues a better wor- 
ship. The sanctuary is first described. The 
imperfection of its service is shown in the lim- 
itation and restriction of priestly service, be- 
cause the ordinances were unavailing in the 
realm of conscience. In contrast to this, 
Christ entered a greater tabernacle through a 
greater sacrifice. Therefore His entry was 
once for all, because in the shedding of His 
own blood He dealt with sin finally. The 
superiority of the sacrifice is next emphasized. 
In this matter Christ is at once Priest and 
Sacrifice. He offered Himself through the 
eternal Spirit. The prominent thought in 
this section is that in the priesthood of Christ 
there is a place of worship unlocalized and 
unlimited. Into the better sanctuary through 
the better sacrifice, the worshipper may enter, 
in any place, and at any time, if he come 
through the better Priest. 

Still dealing with worship, the subject of 
the superiority of the service is finally dealt 
with. In this connection, for special reason, 
the writer restates the fact of the superiority 
of the priesthood of Jesus, in the matters of 



Christ the Final Speech of God 259 

sacrifices and offerings. The sacrifices of the 
old economy could never perfect men. By the 
One Sacrifice of Christ, He perfects for ever 
the sanctified. Moreover, through this offer- 
ing and sacrifice of Christ the worshippers 
are brought into relationship with God, in 
which instead of consciousness of sin, there 
is delight in the doing of His will. 

The better covenant and the better worship 
issue necessarily in the better fellowship. The 
privilege of the worshipper is that in union 
with the Priest he may approach with bold- 
ness. The responsibility of the fellowship is 
that the worshippers should "draw near," 
"hold fast,'' and "consider one another." The 
preparation for such approach is then clearly 
stated. All this is to be the more carefully 
observed because of the assurance that the 
High Priest Who ministers will appear again, 
and that the day is drawing nigh. 

Then follows the fifth solemn warning of 
the epistle, which deals again with the sin of 
apostasy. The nature of that sin is described 
in terrible words: "trodden under foot the 
Son of God, . . . accounted the blood of the 
covenant ... an unholy thing, . . . done de- 
spite unto the Spirit of grace." To those 
guilty of such sin there can remain nothing 
but judgment, and the fierceness of fire. The 



260 Hebrews 



warning ends with words full of hope. They 
had "endured"; and are urged therefore not 
to cast away their boldness; and their faith 
is encouraged by a further reminder of the 
certainty of the second advent of Jesus. 

B. The Appeal. Fruitfulness of Faith 

The letter now passes to its second division, 
which consists of an appeal made by the 
writer, describing the fruitfulness of faith; 
and falls into two sections, in the first of 
which he masses the evidence by calling the 
witnesses; while in the second he makes his 
appeal. 

Quoting from the prophecy of Habakkuk he 
shows that the principle of life is faith, and 
makes it clear that apostasy issues in death. 
This he then illustrates on the positive side. 
His first illustration is all-inclusive in its 
teaching concerning the spiritual origin of all 
things. He then passes in rapid review the 
outstanding names in the history of the He- 
brew people, in each case showing that at the 
centre of all their victories lay the principle 
of faith. He then gives a list of names, each 
one of which stands for some triumph through 
faith; and immediately following a list of 
deeds, all accomplished in the selfsame power. 
And yet again, he describes the sufferings en- 



Christ the Final Speech of God 261 

dured in the strength of faith. The matter of 
supreme interest in this massing of the wit- 
nesses is the variety of types of character, of 
circumstances, in all of which the principle of 
victory is the same. The fruitfulness of faith 
in all these is yet more clearly revealed in the 
closing declaration that none of them received 
the promise. Faith was strong enough to en- 
able them to endure, postponing their final 
realization until the great promises of God 
should be perfectly wrought out in the history 
of men. 

Having thus shown that faith was the abid- 
ing condition of victorious life under the old 
economy, the writer declares it to be the abid- 
ing condition of victorious life under the new. 
The one supreme Witness is presented to the 
mind as the Author and Perfecter of faith. 
Seeing the witnesses, and looking at the Wit- 
ness, the readers are urged to lay aside 
weights, and the sin of unbelief, in order that 
they may run. 

Then follows the great appeal. It opens by 
a careful and yet tender setting forth of the 
perils which threaten the life of faith. The 
first is that of failure to respond to chasten- 
ing, and in order to safeguard them against 
such failure he explains the real meaning of 
their suffering and chastening. 



262 Hebrews 



The second peril is that of falling short of 
the grace of God, which falling short mani- 
fests itself in disputes, and differences, caused 
by moral failure; and he urges them to look 
carefully lest they so fail. 

Then in order to their encouragement, the 
writer brings graphically before the mind the 
contrast between the old economy and the 
new. The former was characterized by terror 
and majesty, of which he gives seven illustra- 
tions. The new is characterized by tender- 
ness and mercy, of which he gives eight illus- 
trations. The old revealed distance, and 
filled the heart with fear. The new reveals 
the way of approach, and should inspire with 
faith. 

At last he utters the appeal itself. The 
first words "See that ye refuse not Him that 
speaketh'^ should be read in connection with 
the affirmation in the introduction of the let- 
ter. "God . . . hath spoken ... in His Son.'' 
Between that first affirmation and this final 
appeal lie all the arguments concerning the 
superiority of the speech of the Son. The 
writer shows that greater privilege means 
greater responsibility, and consequently 
creates graver peril. Therefore they are 
charged not to refuse, and in order that they 
may not, they are further charged to have 



Christ the Final Speech of God 263 

grace. The last word "Our God is a consum- 
ing fire'' will affect the conscience according 
to its condition. The men of faith will rejoice 
in the fire which purifies ; the men of apostasy 
will tremble in the fire which destroys. 

Conclusion 

The conclusion of the letter consists of a 
series of injunctions which illustrate the value 
of faith, in the superior relationships created 
by the revelation made through the Son. The 
conduct of faith will be that of love in all prac- 
tical application. The encouragement of faith 
is, "Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and to- 
day, and for ever.'' The worship of faith 
consists of leaving the old economy, by going 
without the camp, and entering into the new 
by worshipping within the veil. The fellow- 
ship of faith is to express itself in doing good 
and communicating. 

The last paragraph is a personal conclusion, 
first urging the readers to pray for those in 
the ministry, and finally recording the prayer 
of the writer for those to whom his letter is 
addressed.

JAMES 

THIS epistle is pre-eminently practical. 
The ethics of Christianity are perhaps 
more forcefully taught here than in any of 
the apostolic writings. The letter has often, 
therefore, been spoken of as being devoted to 
the subject of works; and Luther, imagining 
that it contradicted the doctrine of justifica- 
tion by faith as set forth by Paul, decided 
against its inspiration, denying its right to a 
place in the canon. It is easy to understand 
Luther's position when his times are remem- 
bered, and the necessity there was for insist- 
ence upon faith as the root principle of Chris- 
tian relationship. As a matter of fact, how- 
ever; there is no epistle which reveals more 
clearly the necessity for faith than that of 
James. While Romans deals with faith as the 
principle from which works issue, James in- 
sists upon works as necessary for the demon- 
stration of faith. It is around the thought of 
faith that the epistle may best be analyzed.

Principle of Action toward Man ( ii. ) ; Faith

Faith as a Principle of Purity in Character 
(iv.) ; Conclusion (v.). 

Introduction 

James introduced himself briefly and com- 
prehensively as a servant of God and of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. His letter was written to 
the "twelve tribes which are of the dispersion" 
— that is, to Christian Israelites not resident 
in Jerusalem. 

A. Faith as a Principle of Victory in 
Temptation 

The condition of these Christians was that 
of persons in the midst of temptation and 
trial; and in this first division James recog- 
nized the place of temptation, then dealt with 
faith as a principle of victory; finally draw- 
ing a sharp contrast between false and true 
religion. 

First dealing with temptation as adversity 
of circumstances he declared that its issue is 
that they might be perfect and entire, lacking 
in nothing. He then cited three illustrations 
of this kind of temptation — lack of wisdom, 
lack of position, and lack of need, closing with 
a beatitude on such as endure. He then 
passed to speak of temptation as allurement 
to sin, declaring that God is never the Author 



Christ and His Ethic 269 

of such, and showing that it consists in an 
appeal made to a proper desire to meet its de- 
mand in an improper way or time. 

He next proceeded to show that the Word 
of God is the stronghold for faith as it meets 
temptation. Recognizing the fact that every 
good gift and perfect boon is from God, and 
therefore not evil in itself, James insisted that 
such as were born again must set forth the 
Divine intention in human life. The first re- 
sponsibility in order to obedience is that the 
implanted Word should be received with meek- 
ness. The second responsibility is that of 
actual and active obedience to the Word thus 
received. In order to this the attitude must 
be that of looking into, and so continuing; 
that is, of determined attention to the Word, 
and abandonment to its claim. 

This division closes with a remarkable con- 
trast between false and true religion, between 
the man who thinks himself to be religious, 
and pure religion. Faith therefore fastening 
upon the Word is the principle of victory in 
temptation. 

B. Faith as a Principle of Action toward 
Men 

In dealing with faith as a principle of ac- 
tion toward men, James first described the 



270 James 

failure of conduct which he condemned; and 
then gave the teaching which corrects such 
wrong conduct; finally crystallizing the argu- 
ment in a brief statement of principle. 

The failure he condemned was that of re- 
spect of persons which expresses itself in the 
worship of wealth. Those who are guilty of 
this conduct do not hold the faith of the Lord 
Jesus Christ. They despise the poor, whereas, 
according to the teaching of their Master, the 
poor are heirs of the Kingdom. While it is 
a good thing to fulfil the royal law of love to 
neighbours, it is an evil thing to have respect 
of persons. 

To correct the failure James charged them 
first of all to speak and act as men to be 
judged by the law of liberty; and then, in one 
of the strongest passages in the whole letter, 
showed the profitlessness of faith which does 
not express itself in works, illustrating by ref- 
erence to Abraham, the father of the faithful, 
and to Rahab, a woman outside the covenant. 
In each case faith was the vital principle, but 
it was demonstrated by works. 

The closing declaration summarizes the 
division, and is indeed the central truth of the 
whole epistle. A faith which does not express 
itself in conduct is as dead as a body from 
which the spirit has departed. 



Christ and His Ethic 271 

c. Faith as a Principle of Wisdom in 
Speech 

After uttering a warning as to public teach- 
ing, James described the peril of the tongue, 
and finally showed the effect of faith upon its 
use. 

When referring to false religion, the one 
illustration he gave was that of an unbridled 
tongue. He then showed the disastrous effects 
which may be produced thereby. Perhaps 
more burning and scorching words are hardly 
to be found in the whole of the New Testa- 
ment. There would seem to be a contrast 
suggested between the tongue set on fire by 
hell, and the tongue of fire. Speech always 
waits for inspiration, and such inspiration 
comes out of the awful depths of evil, or from 
the Spirit of the living God. 

He then declared that true wisdom and un- 
derstanding will manifest itself in life; that 
is to say, he practically affirmed that the 
silence which is the outcome of faith is the 
most eloquent testimony to consistent life. 
In immediate contrast to the effects of un- 
bridled speech, he described the true wisdom 
as to character and result; and the contrast 
is extremely vivid. In the description of the 
former there is the thought of tempest and 



272 James 

conflict, strife and malice ; in that of the latter 
there is the manifestation of calm and seren- 
ity, of quietness and love. Thus the effect of 
faith upon that natural character from which 
speech springs is shown; and thus the effect 
of faith upon speech itself. 

D. Faith as a Principle of Purity in Char- 
acter 

Here again the writer described failure, cor- 
rected it, and finally declared the true prin- 
ciple of victory. 

The failure is that of wars and fightings 
arising from lust, issuing in envy, and daring 
even to lay tribute on prayer. He asked, 
"Doth the Spirit which He made to dwell in 
you, long unto envying?'^ evidently intending 
to indicate that the only answer to such a 
question must be a negative one. The Spirit 
which God makes to dwell in us does not 
create desire which issues in envy. The char- 
acter which is self-seeking and unclean, re- 
sults from lack of faith in God, manifested 
in failure to submit to the indwelling 
Spirit. 

The Divine corrective to these terrible con- 
ditions is then dealt with, first as to the all- 
inclusive gift of God, and secondly as to 
human responsibility. The government ds 



Christ and His Ethic 273 

that of grace. The responsibility is marked 
in a series of injunctions. 

Finally he revealed the true principle of 
purity. Faith in God will produce love, 
rather than censoriousness toward men. Sec- 
ondly, faith in God means dependence upon 
Him which is actual and active. 

Conclusion 

In conclusion the writer addressed himself 
first in solemn indictment and terrible warn- 
ing to the rich. The cry of the oppressed 
comes into the ears of God as a plea which is 
never heard in vain. In the balances and pro- 
portion of the Divine government, nemesis in- 
evitably follows upon any gain which is the 
result of injury done to others. 

Turning to those who suffer, he addressed 
to them words as full of tender comfort as 
those directed to the oppressors were full of 
fiery indignation. He called them to patience 
in the midst of testing, first with God in the 
understanding of the meaning of His perfect 
waiting for their perfecting, and then with 
each other. To patience and simplicity of 
speech he urged them by two examples — that 
of the prophets, and that of Job. 

The last paragraph of the letter contains 
advice and instructions for differing expert- 



274 James 



ences and things. ^^Is any . . . suffering?" 
"Is any cheerful?" "Is any . . . sick?" Those 
who suffer should pray. Those who are cheer- 
ful should praise. As to the sick, the whole 
paragraph, from verse fourteen to the end, 
must be read for correct understanding of any 
portion thereof. The raising of the sick is 
united with the forgiveness of sin, and imme- 
diately upon this statement there follows the 
injunction to confess sins. The particular 
cases of sickness in mind were those resulting 
from wrong-doing. The calling in of the 
elders of the Church indicated the relation be- 
tween the sickness and matters of spiritual 
import. The use of oil was in itself an indi- 
cation of the necessity for the employment of 
means. The instruction to pray shows that 
the Christian man will never depend upon 
natural means alone. The most important 
teaching of this final paragraph is that where 
sickness is related to wrong-doing, by confes- 
sion and by recognition of church responsi- 
bility sin may be removed, and the sickness 
consequent upon it healed. The value of this 
exercise of confession and forgiveness is em- 
phasized by the words with which the letter 
closes.

I PETER 

THIS letter was directed to the same per- 
sons as that of James. Its main pur- 
pose is the establishing of such as are passing 
through a period of suffering and testing. In 
the solemn days in which the Lord had fore- 
told Peter's fall and restoration, He had said 
to him, "When once thou hast turned again, 
establish thy brethren." In both his epistles 
the apostle carried out that commission. 

The letter abounds with references to his 
own experiences. Its twofold method is in- 
dicated in the closing words, "exhorting, and 
testifying" (v. 12). The word "exhorting" is 
derived from the same root as Paraclete, and 
thus reveals the nature of the exhortation. 
The word "testifying" means witnessing, in 
the sense in which the Lord had said to His 
disciples that they should be witnesses to 
Him. Thus in the power of the Paraclete, 
Peter exhorted, and emphasized his exhorta- 
tion by testifying to Him of Whom the Holy 
Spirit is Representative and Administrator. 
These two aspects of the epistle are inter- 
mixed, the apostle perpetually passing from 

277 



278 I Peter 



exhortation to testimony. The epistle may 
thus be divided; Introduction (i. 1, 2) ; Estab- 
lished for Testing in Confidence (i. 3-ii. 3) ; 
Established for Testing in Conduct (ii. 4-iii. 
9) ; Established for Testing in Character (iii. 
10-v. 7) ; Established for Testing in Conflict 
(v. 8-11) ; Conclusion (v. 12-14). 

Introduction 

The apostle introduced himself by the name 
which Jesus gave him, "Peter," and an- 
nounced his apostleship. He described those 
to whom he wrote as "the elect,'^ and explained 
the meaning of his own term. Election is 
"according to the foreknowledge of God.'' Its 
process of realization is "in sanctification of 
the Spirit.'' Its purpose is "unto obedience 
and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ." 
He saluted his readers with the words of the 
new covenant; "grace" indicating all the 
favour of God operative through the work of 
Jesus; and "peace," the resulting condition 
and consciousness of the life. 

A. Established for Testing in Confidence 
In order to establish them for testing in con- 
fidence, he first described the life of faith; 
then showed the place of the proving of faith ; 
and finally gave them practical exhortation as 
to the practice of faith. 



Christ the Strength of His People 279 

As to the origin of the life of faith, he re- 
minded them that the beginning of their life 
was by the act of God, in which He "begat us 
again" through the liberation of the life of 
Christ in resurrection. The final issue of this 
is that of an inheritance, all the characteris- 
tics of which are in direct contrast to the in- 
heritances of earth. It is "incorruptible," 
while everything here is corruptible ; it is "un- 
defiled," while everything here is tainted with 
defilement ; it "fadeth not away," while every- 
thing here is passing, even while it is pos- 
sessed ; it is "reserved in heaven," while every- 
thing here is overshadowed by the coming of 
death. The assurance of the ultimate realiza- 
tion lies in the fact that the saints are guarded 
by the power of God. 

The value of the present proving, is the con- 
sequent vindication at the revelation of Jesus 
Christ. The principle of strength in the proc- 
ess of proving, is that of love which springs 
out of perfect confidence in the Lord Himself. 
The salvation which is to be revealed is even 
now received by faith, and so the joy of the 
present is of the nature of that which is to 
come; and out of this grows the victory of 
courage and gladness over all the grief of the 
manifold trials of to-day. He finally re- 
minded them that this wonderful salvation 



280 I Peter 



had been the subject of the inquiries and the 
search of the prophets of old; and angels 
themselves had desired to look into them. 

Having set the testing of their confidence in 
relation to its purpose, the apostle proceeded 
to practical exhortations, dealing first with 
individual, and then with relative responsi- 
bility. In personal life the attitude to be 
maintained is that of strenuous readiness for 
all present emergencies, in the absolute cer- 
tainty of the ultimate issue. The ruling prin- 
ciple of obedience is to be that of relationship 
to God as children. He concluded the per- 
sonal injunctions with the strongest argument 
it was possible for him to use. They had been 
redeemed at infinite cost. In dealing with 
the relative practice, the individual obedience 
is taken for granted. The only injunction 
laid upon the saints, conditioning their rela- 
tion to each other, is that of love. The char- 
acter of the love enjoined is described as being 
"from the heart fervently." The energy suffi- 
cient to enable obedience in this matter is that 
of the new birth, wherein life, containing 
forces equal to every demand, is received. The 
method of obedience is that of putting away 
all things contrary to the spirit of love, and 
the sustenance of life by the Word, 



Christ the Strength of His People 281 

B. Established for Testing in Conduct 

Passing from the subject of the testing of 
confidence to that which is closely allied, the 
testing of conduct, the apostle first dealt with 
the life of holiness, and the practice of holi- 
ness. 

In dealing with the life of holiness he de- 
scribed the Church as a building, of which 
the chief corner Stone is the living Christ, and 
in which all members are living stones, deriv- 
ing from Him a preciousness. The fellowship 
of this preciousness issues in fellowship in the 
suffering resulting from rejection by the men 
of the world. In a passage of remarkable 
force and beauty, the vocation of the Church 
is declared to be that of the manifestation of 
the excellencies of God. 

The application of this master principle 
immediately follows. Generally, it means that 
the members of the Church are to behave as 
those not of the world, conducting themselves 
among outsiders in a seemly manner in order 
to silence slander, and vindicate God. 

This general principle is then illustrated in 
its national bearing. Submission to God does 
not express itself in disobedience to earthly 
government, but rather in subjection to 
such. 



282 I Peter 



The application to household relationships 
illustrates how things generally considered 
menial are transfigured in the light of Chris- 
tian experience. Servants are to be subject, 
not only to masters who are reasonable, but 
also to the froward. For the encouragement 
of such the apostle quoted the great example 
of Christ, to Whom they have returned, and in 
relation to Whom it is possible for them to 
obey. 

The application to home relationships be- 
gins with the marriage relation. The attitude 
of the wife is to be that of subjection, the true 
adornment of woman being that of womanly 
character. The injunction to husbands is that 
they dwell with their wives according to 
knowledge. Thus the woman is to be subject 
to a love which acts in knowledge, and not in 
selfishness and ignorance. The final reason 
for the fulfilment of the true ideal of the 
marriage relationship is that "prayers be not 
hindered," a forceful suggestion that the 
whole married life is consecrated by mutual 
intercession. 

The section closes with general exhortations 
to the cultivation of such disposition as shall 
fulfil the ideals in conduct. 



Christ the Strength of His People 283 

c. Established for Testing in Character 

The apostle now passed to the establishing 
of those tested as a result of their realization 
of the true Christian character, and he first 
described the life of victory, and then indi- 
cated the process of yictory. 

He commenced with a quotation from the 
Psalms, which calls to a life of holiness and 
declares a truth concerning the attitude of 
God towards men. In the light of this truth, 
those who suffer for character are urged to be 
zealous of that which is good. The one su- 
preme responsibility is expressed in the words, 
"Sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord." 
The perfect Pattern for the believer in order 
to victory is Christ Himself, and the apostle 
stated comprehensively the facts of the suffer- 
ing and victory of Christ. These are. His 
death and resurrection; His descent into 
Hades and proclamation of the evangel; His 
ascension to the right hand of God and as- 
sumption of authority. The force of the ar- 
gument in its bearing on suffering saints is 
that of showing how through suffering Christ 
reached a triumph. Through His suffering 
He was able to make proclamation of His 
evangel in Hades, and then to ascend to the 
place of final authority, even above all angels 



284 I Peter 



and authorities and powers. Through their 
baptism of suffering they also find their way 
into victory. 

The process of this victory is therefore, first 
that of being armed with the same mind. This 
mind belongs to the saints, and is a good con- 
science through the finished work of Christ. 
Let them act in the power of it by ceasing from 
sin, and all those gratifications of the flesh- 
life which has characterized their past. The 
result of that will be their suffering, but the 
issue will be their triumph in the Gospel, as 
through them it is preached to others. The 
apostle then suddenly turned the light of the 
future on to the present. "The end of all 
things is at hand." The darkness of every day 
has on it the purple promise of the end. The 
proper effect of this certainty is then described 
in its personal and relative aspects. The indi- 
vidual is that they be of "sound mind" and 
"sober unto prayer." Relatively, love is to be 
the master motive, and this is to find expres- 
sion in hospitality and mutual ministration. 

The apostle then showed that the fiery trial 
resulting from loyalty to Christ is inevitable, 
as partnership in the sufferings of Christ. In 
such fellowship with His sufferings they are 
to rejoice, inasmuch as the issue must be that 
of fellowship in His glory. That result, how- 



Christ the Strength of His People 285 



ever, does not follow suffering which is the 
consequence of sin; if a child of God suffer 
through wrong-doing, there must be no expec- 
tation of glory issuing therefrom. Remem- 
bering that the fires through which His chil- 
dren pass are watched by God, Who never al- 
lows them to harm His own, let them commit 
their souls to Him. 

Finally the apostle gave instructions as to 
the orderliness of the Church. The leaders are 
to care for the flock, not lording it over them, 
but serving them; not indeed under the au- 
thority of the flock, but under that of the Lord 
and Master, Who is the chief Shepherd. The 
younger are to be in subjection. All of them 
are to gird themselves to service, which is to 
be characterized by humility, and by freedom 
from all anxiety. 

D. Established for Testing in Conflict 

The life of the saint is one of conflict. The 
apostle named the adversary ; he is the devil ; 
he is neither careless nor neutral ; his business 
is the destruction of all good. To those to 
whom Peter wrote the attitude of the devil 
was that of a roaring lion. It is not always 
so. Sometimes his opposition is stealthy and 
slimy as that of the serpent. At others it is 
radiant and fascinating as that of an angel. 



286 I Peter 



His purpose is always the same, "seeking 
whom he may devour'' ; and his method is ever 
that of seeking, watching for the weak mo- 
ment, the unguarded entrance, the unprepared 
occasion. The attitude of the Christian to- 
ward this foe is to be that of soberness, watch- 
fulness, and actual conflict. An incentive to 
all this is that we are not alone. Our brethren 
in the world are all fighting. Our battle is 
not our own ; it is theirs also. They fight for 
us ; and we for them. The strength of conflict 
is the certainty that the God of all grace will 
through the process accomplish His purpose. 

Conclusion 

In the last words the apostle indicated the 
method of the letter, with which we dealt in 
the introduction; and closed with personal 
salutations and the benediction of peace.

II PETER 

THIS letter is addressed to the same per- 
sons as the first. While the purpose of 
the first was the strengthening of those who 
were passing through a period of testing from 
without, this is for their strengthening in view 
of the dangers threatening them within the 
Church. The aim of the epistle may be gath- 
ered from the concluding exhortation: ^'Be- 
ware/' "Grow." It is a solemn warning 
against the perils that threaten the inner life 
of the Church, and an exhortation to growth 
in that "grace and knowledge'^ in which the 
perils will be overcome. It may thus be ana- 
lyzed; Introduction (i. 1, 2); Principles of 
Preservation (i. 3-21) ; Perils threatening (IL- 
iii. 9) ; Conclusion (iii. 10-18). 

Introduction 

Through varied experiences the writer had 
come into possession of the character which 
the surname "Peter" suggested. As he com- 
menced a letter intended to strengthen his 
brethren for the testing arising from perils 
threatening them within the Church, he in- 

289 



290 II Peter 



troduced himself by the names of "Simon 
Peter," the first of which speaks of his own 
old life of instability, and the second of the 
character of stability into which he had been 
brought. Describing himself as a servant and 
apostle of Jesus Christ, he addressed his 
brethren as having a "like precious faith,'^ thus 
reminding them that the faith which in his 
case was preserved through the supplication 
of his Lord, was theirs also. His ultimate de- 
sire for them was that they might have knowl- 
edge. As the perils against which he w^as 
about to warn them resulted from false teach- 
ing, so the principle of preservation was that 
of knowledge. 

A. The Principles of Preservation 

In dealing with the principles of preserva- 
tion, the apostle first stated and then defended 
them. 

The statement of principles consists of a 
setting forth of the actual facts of the perfect 
provision, and a declaration of the consequent 
responsibility of the saints. The provision is 
described first as to present possession; "all 
things that pertain unto life and godliness" 
are granted through the knowledge of Him 
Who called "by His glory and virtue." This 
possession is made more sure by the "precious 



Christ the Strength of His People 291 

and exceeding great promises." Because of 
this perfect provision the saints are called to 
diligence and the development of their re- 
sources ; and to more diligence, in the light of 
the things of the eternal Kingdom, wherein all 
the meaning of participation in the Divine na- 
ture will be realized. 

Having thus stated the principles of pres. 
ervation, the apostle defended the truth of hi& 
statement. He w^as conscious of his approach- 
ing departure, and expressed his determina* 
tion to stir them up by putting them in re- 
membrance. There flamed upon him the 
memory of the Mount of Transfiguration ; and 
the effect which his experiences there had upon 
him are very evident here. On that mount he 
had seen the "Power" and "Coming" of the 
Lord Jesus Christ. These words correspond 
to the present and future provision with 
which he had already dealt. On that holy 
mount moreover he heard the voice of God, and 
that voice confirmed for him the prophecies of 
the past, which were as "a lamp shining in a 
dark place." 

B, The Perils 

Having thus described the principles of pres- 
ervation, the apostle now dealt with the perils 
threatening the Church from within. These 



292 II Peter 



are two, the one growing out of the other. The 
first is that of false teachers, which threatens 
the power. The second is that of the materiali- 
zation of mind resulting from their teaching, 
which threatens the coming. 

As in the days of ancient prophecy there 
were false prophets, so now there will be false 
teachers; and many will follow, and the way 
of truth be evil spoken of. The judgment of 
God against such is sure, and this assertion is 
defended by the citation of the cases of the 
casting out of the angels, the destruction of 
the ancient world, and of the cities of Sodom 
and Gomorrah. Nevertheless such judgment 
will be discriminative. ^'The Lord knoweth 
how to deliver." The apostle then proceeded 
to describe more particularly the characteris- 
tics of those whom he had in mind. A more 
scathing description it is not possible to find. 
The words seem to sting like whips of fire. 
He described their method. As to themselves, 
he referred to them as "having eyes full of 
adultery, and that cannot cease from sin." 
Their method was that of the enticement of 
weak souls. With relentless persistence he 
tore away the attractive outer garments of the 
false teachers, and revealed the loathsomeness 
of the self-centred covetousness that lurked be- 
hind. This is no dainty handling of false 



Christ the Strength of His People 293 

teachers. The terrible manner of it is due to 
the apostle's consciousness that the effect of 
false teaching is that of denying the power of 
Christ, which is the present blessing of the 
saints. To deny the Lord in any particular is 
to loosen the bondage of the soul to Him, and 
to open the door to the incoming of all evil. 

False teaching which denies the power of 
Christ issues in false thinking which questions 
the coming of Christ. There will be mockers 
who will walk in lust, and make sport of the 
great hope of the Church, declaring that 
things will continue as they have done. To 
strengthen his readers against the new peril, 
the apostle reminded them of the prophecies 
and the commandment of the Lord. The ar- 
gument that as things have been they remain is 
contested first by reference to the deluge, and 
then by the declaration that a fire judgment 
is reserved for this earth. What appears to 
be delay is due to the long-suffering of God, 
with Whom time does not exist. 

Conclusion 

The conclusion consists of a summary of 
teaching grouped around these two subjects of 
the coming and the power of the Lord, with a 
final warning and injunction. The day of the 
Lord will come. It will be destructive. The 



294 II Peter 



heavens and the elements will be burned up. 
We may hasten that day by holy living and 
godliness. It will also be constructive, for 
there will be ^^new heavens and a new earth 
wherein dwelleth righteousness." 

The result of this conviction in the experi- 
ence of the saints should be new appropria- 
tion of the power. Personally this means dili- 
gence for the creation of the character for 
which at His coming He will seek. Relatively 
it means patience during the delay, knowing 
that it is caused by His long-suffering. 

All this leads to the final exhortation, which 
is twofold. "Bew'are" — that marks the atti- 
tude of caution. "Grow'' — that indicates the 
necessity for progress. To conclude, there is 
a brief and comprehensive doxology; glory to 
the Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ, "both 
now," that is, in response to His powder, and 
"for ever," that is, as the result of His coming. 
Thus the soul is established in Him against all 
possibilities and perils, both now^ and for ever.

I JOHN 

THIS is probably the last apostolic mes- 
sage to the whole Church. If the second 
and third epistles were written later, they 
were to individuals. This letter is catholic in j 
the fullest sense of the word, being addressed 
to no particular church or district, and deal- 
ing with the fundamental question of the life 
which is the true bond of the Church's unity. 

A comparison of John xx. 31 and 1 John 
V. 13 will show the gospel and epistle to be 
complementary. The gospel was written that 
men might have life, the epistle that believers 
might know they had life. In the former we 
have Divine live as revealed in Christ; in the 
latter the same life as realized in the Chris- 
tian. The gospel declares the way of life 
through the incarnate Son ; the epistle unfolds 
the nature of that life as possessed by the chil- 
dren of God. 

The subject of the epistle is that of fellow- 
ship with God, into which believers are intro- 
duced through their union with Christ. Its 
divisions mark the subjects dealt with. These 

297 



298 I John 

subjects overlap in each case. This is the out- 
come of the fact that they are closely inter- 
related, the three forming phases of a great 
whole. They may be indicated thus; Intro- 
duction (i. 1-4) ; Fellowship with God as Light 
(i. 5-ii.) ; Fellowship with God as Love (iii.- 
iv.) ; Fellowship with God as Life (v. 1-12) ; 
Conclusion (v. 13-21). 

Introduction 

By way of introduction John affirmed his 
knowledge, in common with others, of the cer- 
tainty that eternal life was manifested in the 
Word. "We have heard ... we have seen 
. . . beheld . . . our hands handled." The 
word "that" refers in each case to a Person. 
As in the gospel, the "Word" which cannot be 
touched, became flesh which could be touched, 
so here, "the Word of life," which is a quantity 
intangible, imponderable, and immeasurable, 
had yet been touched and handled by men. 
The purpose of the manifestation was that of 
bringing men into fellowship with God. This 
the apostle proceeded to discuss under the 
three headings of light, love, and life, showing 
not only the privileges but also the responsi- 
bilities of such fellowship. 



C hrist and Fellowship with God 299 

A. Fellowship with God. God is Light 

In this division the apostle first dealt with 
the fellowship of the saints with God in light, 
and then described the perils of darkness. 

The first great message of "the Word of 
life-' to men is that "God is light.'' This is a 
truth never to be lost sight of. To forget it is 
to minimize the meaning of the next declara- 
tion that "God is love." The exercise of such 
fellowship on the part of the believer consists 
of walking in the light of God. Yet because 
of perpetual imperfection even in holy things, 
there is need of constant cleansing, and this is 
provided in "the blood of Jesus His Son." 
Light makes sin known. Sins of the past are 
forgiven, and the soul is cleansed from un- 
righteousness. The apostle was careful to 
state that he wrote in order that we sin not. 
He added, however, a gracious declaration con- 
cerning the provision of the Advocate Jesus, 
through Whom sins might be put away. Hav- 
ing stated the nature and conditions of fel- 
lowship with God as light, the apostle pro- 
ceeded to speak of the tests whereby we may 
know our relation to light, first as to God, and 
then as to our fellow-men. The test of light is 
love — love to God exemplified in obedience. 
The supreme commandment was not new, in 



300 I John 

that it was the original Divine intention for 
man. Yet it was new in its new interpreta- 
tion in Christ, and in the experience of men 
who in its power love each other. 

In approaching the subject of the perils of 
darkness against which he was about to utter 
warnings, the apostle, in a beautiful passage, 
declared the groundwork of his appeal to be 
the experience of believers in Christ. The 
perils against which he warned believers were 
those of materialism, and the false spirit of 
Antichrist. The description of worldliness is 
very clear. It consists in ^^the lust of the 
flesh," that is, desires which are wholly of the 
flesh, without the control of the spirit; "the 
lust of the eyes," that is, desire to see things 
which minister to the flesh only, evil curiosity 
to contemplate unholy things; "the vainglory 
of life," that is, satisfaction and boasting in 
things which are of the world only, and are 
passing and perishing. He then described the 
spirit of Antichrist to be that of denying that 
Jesus is the Christ, which denial involves also 
the denial of the Father and the Son. The 
Church needs to be ever on the watch against 
such desires or teachings. Her safety con- 
sists in the fact that she has the record as re- 
ceived "from the beginning"; and moreover, 
that she has that anointing of the indwelling 



Christ and Fellowship with God 301 

Spirit which interprets and explains the things 
received, so that she has no need that any one 
teach her. 

B. Fellowship with God. God is Love 

In this division the apostle dealt with the 
fellowship of the saints with God in love, and 
then declared the perils of hatred. 

The lo-^e o^ God is supremely manifest in 
that we are called "children of God." All the 
meaning of this relationship we do not yet 
know, but this much is certain that eventually 
we shall be like Him. The present influence 
of this hope, born of love, is that he that has 
it purifies himself. The apostle proceeded to 
declare that in Christ there is no need for any 
one to sin, and that if a believer do so it must 
be in violation of the very life-principle which 
makes him a child of God. The test of fellow- 
ship with God as love is righteousness of con- 
duct, and love one to another. The result of 
fellowship with God as love, will be that of 
hatred toward us on the part of the world. 
Yet such hatred is to be answered by the love 
of the Christian, such love being the proof of 
the presence of the new life. Affirmations of 
love for the men of the world, which are not 
demonstrated by ministry to their actual 
needs, are of no value. The apostle then de- 



302 I John 



clared the test by which we may ourselves 
know that we are of the truth. The true 
anxiety of Christian experience is to possess 
a heart at rest before God. Doubt or uncer- 
tainty in the inward life is ever productive of 
harm. The place of peace and power is that 
of abiding in Him. To keep His command- 
ments is to abide in Him, and to abide in Him 
is to have strength to keep His commandments. 
The all-inclusive commandments are two in 
number. The first is that we should believe in 
Jesus Christ ; and the second is that we should 
love one another. 

Two closely related perils threaten our fel- 
lowship with God as love: those of false 
prophets, and the spirit which actuates them. 
There is a simple and yet searching test which 
the children of God are carefully to apply. 
The testimony of the Spirit of God is to Jesus 
Christ as having come in flesh. Those who 
confess not Jesus are those who deny what the 
Spirit of God aflftrms concerning Him. All 
such are of Antichrist. The test of the spirits 
is the indwelling Spirit. There need be no 
fear, for the indwelling One is greater than the 
spirit working in the world ; but there must be 
no carelessness in the matter of testing. The 
apostle then made an appeal. He used two 
arguments as he urged the duty of love. First, 



Christ and Fellowship with God 303 

the nature of God is love, and therefore those 
begotten of Him should love. The second ar- 
gument was that of the manifestation of the 
love of God. He "sent His only begotten Son 
into the world.'' That is the last word of love, 
and upon it the apostle based his appeal. 
"Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to 
love one another." The argument and appeal 
now go a step further. The perfect love which 
has no fear is the true revelation of God. 
There may be this realization and revelation 
because "as He is, even so are we in this 
world." The apostle's consciousness of the 
glorious perfection of his provision lent stren- 
uousness to his words of application. "If a 
man say I love God, and hateth his brother, he 
is a liar." To every person in actual union 
with God in Christ, love is possible. More- 
over, it is not a privilege merely, it is a stern 
duty. The world waits for the knowledge of 
God, and can only attain it through His reve- 
lation in the love of His children. 

c. Fellowship with God. God is Life 

The final subject is that of our fellowship 
with God in life. This is fundamental, and 
is here shown to be so. Passing back over the 
ground traversed, the apostle shows the rela- 



304 1 John 

tion between life and love, and then between 
life and light. 

As to the first God gives life to the believer. 
The love of one begotten for the One begetting 
issues in love for all begotten. In other words, 
children of the Father love each other. The 
spring and power of love is life. Fellowship 
with God in life issues in love. 

There is also a close relationship between 
life and light. Tho^e who are begotten of 
God overcome the world. Fellowship with the 
light of God is not possible to those who are 
alienated from His life. As the fundamental 
aspect of fellowship with God is fellowship in 
life; and moreover, as man enters into that 
life by believing, the apostle now gives the 
witness upon which faith takes hold. Jesus 
Christ came by water and blood. He "came 
by water" in the sense that the baptism in 
Jordan witnessed to His fellowship with light. 
He "came by blood" in the sense that the pas- 
sion baptism witnessed to His fellowship with 
love. The supreme Witness to this is the 
Spirit. Thus three bear witness: the Spirit, 
of life; the water, of light; the blood, of love. 
These three "agree in one," that is, Jesus. 
Thus has God borne witness to man. The Son 
of God possessed, is the life in which men have 
fellowship with God in light and love. 



Christ and Fellowship with God 305 

Conclusion 

In his concluding words John stated the 
reason of his writing. His purpose was that 
of confirmation. The certainty of life pos- 
sessed, results in a confidence in God which is 
calm and content. That confidence is exer- 
cised in intercession, the limitation of which 
is clearly marked. The letter closes with a 
group of certainties, and an injunction against 
idols. The force of the final warning lies in 
the certainty of the fellowship of the believer 
with God in light, and love, and life.

II JOHN 

THIS second epistle is a concrete applica- 
tion of the principles taught in the first. 
Its subject is the value of truth in the three- 
fold life of fellowship. Its scheme may be 
stated thus; Introduction (1-4); Love (5); 
Love and Light (6); Light and Life (7-9); 
Conclusion (12, 13). 

Introduction 

The repetition of the word "truth" in the 
address gives the keynote to the letter. The 
salutation refers to grace, mercy, and peace, 
which are the effects of truth, the inward sanc- 
tifier ; and the expression of love, the outward 
result. This is followed by a declaration of 
the apostle's joy that the children of the elect 
lady were found walking in truth. 

A. Love 

The apostle then wrote the central and all- 
inclusive commandment, and urged her to obey 
it. It was not a new commandment, but the 
repetition of that possessed from the begin- 
ning. 

809 



310 II John 



B. Love and Light 

Then followed the statement of supreme im- 
portance that love is obedience to light. The 
commandment heard from the beginning was 
that of love. Love, therefore, is obedience to 
the commandment. 

c. Light and Life 

All already written was preliminary to the 
warnings which followed, and the necessity 
for which constituted the real occasion of the 
letter. Deceivers were gone forth into the 
world, denying essential truth concerning the 
Christ. Because love is walking in light, the 
test of love is light. Any consent to darkness 
out of a so-called charity, is not true love. 
Loyalty to truth concerning the Person of 
Christ is the true way of love, and any charity 
which compromises that is false, and eventu- 
ally violates love. 

The teaching against which the apostle 
warned the elect lady was progressive teach- 
ing. Progress out of first principles is retro- 
gression. The stern requirement of the apos- 
tle manifests the sanctified son of thunder, 
and the determined apostle of love. No hos- 
pitality or greeting must be given to those who 



Christ and Fellowship with God 311 

by false teaching imperil the life, and light, 
and love, of the believer. 

The special teaching of this letter may thus 
be summarized. Christianity is love. Love 
is dependent upon the light of truth. To deny 
the truth is to make love impossible. The 
continued experience of fellowship is depend- 
ent upon the continued fact of fellowship in 
love and light and life. The continued fact 
of fellowship is proved by the continued ex- 
perience of fellowship. 

Conclusion 

The apostle expressed his hope that he might 
soon see face to face the one to whom he wrote, 
and sent the salutation of the children of her 
elect sister.

Ill JOHN 

THERE are three persons previously men- 
tioned in the New Testament bearing the 
name of Gains : Gains of Macedonia (Acts xix. 
29), Gains of Derbe (Acts xx. 4), and Gains 
of Corinth (1 Cor. i. 14). The Gains to whom 
John wrote may be yet a fonrth. It is, how- 
ever, extremely probable that he was the 
Gains of Corinth, for there is similarity be- 
tween the hospitality which Paul mentioned 
(Rom. xvi. 23) and that commended by 
John. 

This letter is indeed on the subject of that 
hospitality as it revealed love, and afforded 
the apostle an opportunity to utter a warning 
again schism, which is always due to lack of 
love. His argument circles around three per- 
sons — Gains, Diotrephes, and Demetrius. It 
may be divided thus; Introduction (1-4) ; the 
Hospitality of Gains, its Value, Love prac- 
tised (5-8) ; the Arrogance of Diotrephes, its 
Condemnation, Love violated (8-10) ; the Ex- 
ample of Demetrius, its Cause, Love, Light, 
Life (11, 12); Conclusion (13, 14). 

815 



316 III John 



Introduction 

Very tender and delicate is the introduction. 
The apostle^s recognition of the spiritual 
health of Gaius when he prayed that his phys- 
ical prosperity and health might equal it, is 
beautiful. Again the keynote is Truth. As 
in the letter to the elect lady the apostle had 
uttered his warnings against a false charity 
and hospitality, here he commended true love 
and hospitality. If there is a hospitality im- 
possible to loyalty to truth, it is equally true 
there is a kind which such loyalty necessitates 
and inspires. 

A. Gaius. Love Practised 

Certain evangelists had been received and 
entertained by Gaius. For this the apostle 
commended him, and declared that he would 
do well to set them forth on their journey, 
"worthily of God." This is a remarkable 
phrase, and capable of more than one inter- 
pretation. It may mean that Gaius was to 
see in them the messengers of God, and was to 
send them forth in a way befitting such sacred 
calling. It may have reminded Gaius that he 
was a child of God, and urged him to act ac- 
cordingly. In all probability it included both 
these thoughts. The privileges of showing 



Christ and Fellowship with God 317 

hospitality to the messengers of the Gospel is 
set forth in the words, "that we may be fel- 
low-workers for the truth." 

B. DiOTREPHES. LOVE VIOLATED 

In striking contrast to Gains stands Diotre- 
phes. He had refused to receive some who 
were recommended to the Church by John, and 
had gone so far as to cast out of the Church 
those who did receive them. The whole truth 
about this man is seen in one of those illu- 
minative sentences in which the character of 
a man is so often revealed in the Scriptures. 
"Diotrephes, who loveth to have the pre-emi- 
nence." That is the essential violation of love, 
for "love . . . seeketh not her own." This 
is an instance of heterodoxy of spirit or tem- 
per, rather than of intellect. There is no evi- 
dence that this man was teaching false doc- 
trine, but he was not submissive to authority. 
As is always the case, the unsubmissive one 
becomes the greatest tyrant, and thus by dis- 
obedience he manifests his lack of love. As 
loyalty to truth is the sphere of love, so also is 
it the evidence of love. The arrogance of this 
man shows the governing principle of his life 
to be selfishness rather than love. 



318 III John 



0. Demetrius. Love. Light. Life. 

Gaius is urged to imitate good rather than 
evil, and immediately another change is before 
us in the introduction of Demetrius. In all 
likelihood he was the bearer of the letter, and 
John quoted him in direct contrast to Diot- 
rephes. The central statement of the epistle 
is found in verse eleven. "He that doeth good 
is of God; he that doeth evil hath not seen 
God." The relations of love to life and light 
are suggested. Doing good is to be inter- 
preted by the subject of the letter, hospitality. 
Those who act in love thus, do so because they 
are of God, that is, related to Him in the fel- 
lowship of life. Such are Gaius and Deme- 
trius. Those who act in evil by selfishness, 
do so because they have no fellowship with 
God in light, not having seen Him. 

Conclusion 

The letter closes with words anticipatory 
of a meeting, and with a message of peace.

JUDE 

THE subject dealt with in this epistle is 
that of apostasy — its possibility, peril, 
and punishment. It solemnly reveals the re- 
lation existing between the will of man and 
the sovereignty of God. Apostasy is shown to 
be wilful return to ungodliness. Two classes 
are dealt with. Those who "kept not'' and 
are therefore "kept." Those who "keep them- 
selves" and are "kept from stumbling." While 
man is free to will, he is never freed from the 
restraining government of God. It is one of 
the most solemn and searching of the New 
Testament writings, and cannot be carefully 
studied without solemn searching of heart. 
The following analysis may be followed; In- 
troduction (1-3) ; the Danger described 
(4-16) ; the Duty devolving (17-23) ; Conclu- 
sion (24, 25). 

Introduction 

Judas introduced himself as brother of 
James, and servant of eTesus Christ; and his 
letter was addressed to those who were 
"called," "beloved," "kept." He wrote in 

821 



322 Jude 

order to urge upon such the necessity for con- 
tending earnestly for the faith, and what he 
ijieant must be interpreted by all that follows. 

V. The Danger 

The peril threatening those to whom he 
Kjrrote was created by ungodly men, who turn- 
ing grace into an occasion of lasciviousness, 
denied all authority. The perils of such atti- 
tude were illustrated by reference to Israel, 
angels, and the cities of the plain ; all of which 
were cast out from privilege on account of dis- 
obedience. The diversity of these illustra- 
tions emphasizes the underlying principle that 
continuity of privilege is dependent upon con- 
tinuity of fidelity. The arrogance of the atti- 
tude of apostasy is described, and its doom is 
declared in the pronouncement of woe. Its 
meaning is revealed as being the way of Cain, 
which was that of hatred and murder; the 
error of Balaam, which was that of seduction 
and lying ; and the gainsaying of Korah, which 
was that of envy and rebellion. 

Apostasy is then denounced in a passage 
full of fiery force. Jude figuratively showed 
that it means failure to fulfil purpose, and 
then by quotation of the prophecy of Enoch 
declared that failure to fulfil purpose must 
issue in destruction. 



Christ the Perfect and Perfecting Lord 323 

The final description of these men reveals 
their inward fault and motive in two phrases 
— "walking after lusts," and "for the sake of 
advantage." 

B. The Duty 

Turning to the subject of the true attitude 
of believers in the presence of apostasy, he in- 
dicated that there must be first a recognition 
of the danger. It had been foretold by the 
apostles, and may be known by two distin- 
guishing marks. Men guilty of apostasy are 
to be known by their influence — "they make 
separations"; and by their temper — they are 
"sensual" rather than spiritual. 

He then described the sphere and habit of 
safety, the central charge being, "keep your- 
selves in the love of God." This is to be done 
by building on faith, praying in the Spirit, and 
looking for mercy. 

Beyond personal responsibility there is a 
relative duty. "On some have mercy" — that 
is, those in doubt; "some save" — that is, such 
as have been ensnared by the libertines; "on 
some have mercy with fear" — and here per- 
haps the reference is to the libertines them- 
selves. This mercy is not to be the condoning 
of evil, or complicity therewith, but the patient 
hopefulness that seeks to win all. 



324 Jude 

Conclusion 

The apostle closed with a glorious doxology 
which shows that the writer had no panic in 
his heart, even though he was profoundly con- 
scious of the surrounding perils. He ascribed 
to God the Saviour all honour in the immeas- 
urable ages, past and present, for that He is 
able to accomplish the salvation of His trust- 
ing ones in two ways which are all-inclusive; 
as to continuity, "able to guard you from 
stumbling"; and as to consummation, "to set 
you before the presence of His glory."

REVELATION 

THE only satisfactory introduction to the 
book of Revelation is found in the text 
thereof, which deals with authorship, nature, 
origin, method, and intention. Its earliest 
phrase constitutes its title, and indicates its 
content. It is the "unveiling of Jesus Christ." 
Our analysis is based upon the supposition 
that the key to the interpretation of the book 
is found in the final charge of Jesus to John, 
"Write therefore the things which thou sawest, 
and the things which are, and the things which 
shall come to pass after these." 

There is first a Prologue (i. 1-3), followed 
by an Introduction (i. 4-8). Then follow the 
three main divisions dealing with the unveil- 
ing of Jesus Christ; Jesus Christ Himself (i. 
9-20) ; Jesus Christ and the Church (ii., iii.) ; 
Jesus Christ and the Kingdom (iv.-xxii. 5). 
The book closes with an Epilogue (xxii. 6-21). 

Prologue 

The foreword constitutes a key to the study 
of the book as it declares its nature to be that 

827 



828 Revelation 



of the unveiling of Jesus Christ; its origin, 
that God gave the things to His Son to show ; 
and its method, that He signified them by an 
angel to John. It closes with a blessing pro- 
nounced upon those who read, and hear, and 
keep. 

Introduction 

The apostle introduced his writing of the 
message received with a double benediction; 
grace and peace to the churches, glory and 
dominion to Jesus Christ. He then declared 
that the hidden One is yet to be revealed, and 
pronounced the Divine name in all its majesty. 

A. Jesus Christ Himself 

The first division of the book deals with 
what Christ referred to by the phrase "the 
things which thou sawest.'' The apostle de- 
scribed the occasion of the coming to him of 
the unveiling. As to earthly conditions, he 
was in Patmos in tribulation; as to heavenly 
condition, he was "in the Spirit on the Lord's 
day." In these circumstances he beheld the 
vision of the glorious Person of his Lord, as 
"a son of man,'' yet infinitely removed from 
all the sons of men in the splendour of His 
glory. In the presence of so amazing an un- 
veiling John became "as one dead," and then 



The Unveiling of Jesus Christ 329 

heard the voice bidding liiin "fear not/- and 
ultimately commissioning him to write. 

B. Jesus Christ and the Church 

There can be no doubt that the seven letters 
contained in this division were directed to 
churches actually in existence in the days of 
John. Nevertheless they reveal a seven-fold 
condition, lasting through the dispensation of 
the Church, and almost certainly indicate a 
process in Church history. That to the church 
at Ephesus deals with the loss of first love, 
and had special application to the apostolic 
period. That to the church at Smyrna deals 
with the subject of persecution, and had 
special reference to the period from Diocletian 
(A.D. 303), to that of Constantine (a.d. 313), 
That to the church at Pergamum deals with 
the patronage of the world, and had special 
reference to the period commencing with Con- 
stantine, in which the church gained in ma- 
terial splendour. That to the church at Thy- 
atira deals with corruption, and had special 
reference to the Dark Ages. That to the 
church at Sardis deals with reformation, and 
had special reference to the hour of the re- 
birth of evangelical faith under the reformers. 
That to the church at Philadelphia deals with 
the open door for evangelization, and had 



380 Revelation 



special reference to the period ushered in by 
the Puritan movement, which broke into full 
force in the Evangelical Eevival. That to the 
church at Laodicea deals with apostasy, and 
describes the final period prior to the advent 
of the Lord Himself. The careful student of 
this division will find that its supreme value 
consists in the unveiling of Jesus Christ in 
His relation to the Church. His authority, 
His patience, His judgment, are all set forth, 
and it is upon these that the mind should prin- 
cipally dwell in the study. 

c. Jesus Christ and the Kingdom 

The final division of the book opens with 
the phrase, "After these," which is another 
translation of the same phrase rendered "here- 
after," in the commission to John. It indi- 
cates that all that is to follow takes place after 
the conditions described in the previous divi- 
sion, that is, the end of the Church period. 
In it we see the unveiling of Jesus Christ in 
the movements which establish the Kingdom 
in the world. It falls into three sections. The 
first deals with millennial preparation, and is 
by far the largest ; the second in very brief sen- 
tences describes the millennium; while the 
third has to do with millennial issues. 



The Unveiling of Jesus Christ 331 

The subject of millennial preparation is in- 
troduced by preliminary pictures of the heav- 
enly order and the earthly administration, and 
then becomes a symbolic description of the pro- 
cedure. At the centre of everything a Throne 
is established and occupied. In closest con- 
nection therewith are four living ones who in 
ceaseless worship attest the holiness of the 
One Who occupies the Throne. Circling 
around these, four-and-twenty elders declare 
Him worthy to receive the glory, and the hon- 
our, and the power of all created things. 

In the hand of the One Who sits upon the 
Throne lies the programme of events. It is 
written but sealed, and none can know it. The 
Lamb by virtue of victory won is able to take 
the book and unseal it, that the programme 
may be carried out. This fact is heralded by 
the songs of living ones, of elders, of countless 
thousands of angels, and of the whole creation 
of God. Thus in preparation for a descrip- 
tion of the perplexing events which are to fol- 
low, it is revealed that holiness is established 
upon the central Throne, and that it acts 
though Him Who is the Exponent of the in- 
finite Love. 

That part of this section dealing with the 
procedure of millennial preparation is the 
most intricate in the whole book. It is a sym- 



332 Revelation 



bolic prophecy of movements occupying seven 
years, during which evil works itself out to 
final issues under the government of God. In 
this there are tw^o great movements, the first 
dealing with the first three and a half years 
(vi.-ii.). In this there is an interpolation 
(x.-xi. 14). The second movement (xii.- 
xviii.) covers the last three and a half years, 
and is introduced by an interpolation (xii.- 
xiv. ) . 

The events immediately following the end 
of the Church dispensation are symbolically 
set forth. The first seal is opened, and one 
representing false authority is seen going 
"forth conquering and to conquer." The sec- 
ond seal is opened, and carnage and bloodshed 
follow as the outcome of military despotism. 
The third seal is opened, and famine follows 
in the wake of commercial despotism. The 
fourth seal is opened, and death in its most 
terrible forms reigns. In the opening of these 
first four seals the true nature of evil is graph- 
ically set forth, as to its strength and weak- 
ness. At the opening of the fifth seal the cry 
of slaughtered saints is heard, and to the mar- 
tyrs are given the white robes which are the 
reward of fidelity. The opening of the sixth 
seal is immediately followed by premonitions 
of the coming One. The first of four seals re- 



The Unveiling of Jesus Christ 333 

vealed the development of lawless government. 
The fifth gave the cry of the saints, and the 
answer in heaven. At the opening of the sixth, 
signs are given of the established order of true 
government, notwithstanding the apparent vic- 
tory of the false. Restraining angels are now 
seen holding in check the hurricanes of Divine 
judgment, while the sealing of an elect num- 
ber of the servants of God takes place. From 
this sealing the seer turns to contemplate a 
great vision in heaven of a vast multitude lift- 
ing the song of salvation. In response to the 
inquiry of the seer, the angel declares that 
these have come out of the great tribulation. 
At last the seventh seal is opened. Heaven is 
sensible of the stupendous importance of this 
seal, and its songs are hushed, and prayer is 
silent for half an hour. Then seven arch- 
angels receive trumpets, and prepare them- 
selves to sound. 

How long a period elapses between the 
sounding of the trumpets we cannot tell. The 
rapid grouping of the first four would seem to 
suggest their quick succession. The sounding 
of the first is followed by a storm and tempest 
over the earth. The second sounds, and an- 
other convulsion, more terrible than the first, 
follows. The third sounds, and by the touch 
of a star God changes the character of a third 



334 Revelation 



part of the waters of the earth. The fourth 
angel sounds, and the earth is affected by a 
display of power among the heavenly bodies. 
Between the sounding of the fourth and fifth 
trumpets there is a pause. A flying eagle pro- 
claims a threefold coming woe, and the procla- 
mation is an evidence of the long-suffering of 
God. At the sounding of the fifth trumpet 
the procedure of judgment takes on a new 
form. New forces of a spiritual nature pro- 
duce physical pain and death. The sounding 
of the sixth trumpet introduces a period in 
which an army of evil spirits hitherto held in 
bondage are loosened. 

Under the period of the sixth trumpet w^e 
have an interlude which chronicles the events 
preparing the way for the sounding of the 
seventh and last. A strong angel, full of glo 
rious dignity, gives to the seer a book, and 
charges him to eat it. Following this, John 
measures the temple, and two witnesses de- 
liver their testimony for three and a half 
years. It must be remembered that John is 
not now describing what he sees, but writing 
what he is told. The testimony of the wit- 
nesses is not a brief one given between the 
sounding of the sixth and seventh trumpets. 
Between these soundings he is told that they 
exercise their ministry during three and a half 



The Unveiling of Jesus Christ 335 

years. At last the message being so fully de- 
livered that men know it, the witnesses are 
slain. The seventh angel at length sounds, 
and the period ushered in includes all the re- 
maining pre-millennial process. 

At the sounding of this seventh trumpet 
John is given a series of visions dealing with 
the great facts and conditions leading up to 
the things actually following the sounding of 
the trumpet. They constitute a re-statement 
of subjects already dealt with in slightly dif- 
ferent form. The sign of the woman and the 
man-child is, as to the woman, that of the ex- 
ternal manifestation of loyalty to God, which 
includes all ages and dispensations ; and as to 
the man-child, that of the coming out of the 
Church of the Firstborn at the call of Christ 
from that which was external only, at the end 
of the Church period, at the beginning of the 
seven years. Then follows the war in heaven, 
and the casting out of Satan half way through 
the period of tribulation. The scene of con- 
flict is now upon the earth, and Satan is seen 
against the woman. Still reviewing the proc- 
esses of the past three and a half years, the 
seer describes the beasts, and then his atten 
tion is turned again to the heavenly order. 
There we see once more the one hundred and 
forty-four thousand surrounding the Lamb, 



836 Revelation 



while angels in succession set forth the su- 
premacy of God, the fall of Babylon, a warn- 
ing against the mark of the beast, and the 
imminence of judgment. 

Before commencing the detailed description 
of the final processes of judgment, John be- 
held a vision in heaven revealing the prepared 
order. Standing by a sea of glass, mingled 
with fire, is a great host of those who have 
overcome the beast. They are singing the 
song of Moses and the Lamb. Following this 
vision of the victorious hosts John beholds the 
opening Temple in heaven. From thereout 
come the seven angels having the seven last 
plagues. The pouring out of these plagues 
constitutes the final judgments of God upon 
the earth. The long-continued sin of man has 
been that of refusal to submit to Divine gov- 
ernment, and consequent devotion to the lower 
side of his nature. Evil has wrought itself 
out to its most terrible expression, and now 
judgment proceeds without mercy. 

The judgment of Babylon having been an- 
nounced, there follows an unfolding of its true 
nature, and a more detailed account of its 
doom. One of the seven angels calls the seer 
to behold the judgment of the great harlot. 
The name upon her forehead commences with 
the word "Mystery/' Babylon stands for the 



The Unveiling of Jesus Christ 387 

whole system of organized godlessness in the 
history of the human race. From Babel on, 
this spirit has had definite manifestation in 
the affairs of men, and has been maintained 
by material power in some form in every suc- 
cessive age. The angel proceeds to explain 
to John the meaning of the vision. The beast 
upon which the woman sits represents the 
temporal authority which has been the 
strength of spiritual harlotry. After the 
angel has thus revealed the history of mystic 
Babylon under the symbolism of the woman, 
another angel appears, and with a mighty 
voice declares the fall of Babylon. Then an- 
other voice is heard, this time the voice of God 
Himself, uttering a call to a remnant, pro- 
nouncing an all-inclusive verdict on Babylon, 
and declaring its sentence of doom. The fall 
of the city produces entirely opposite effects 
on earth, and in heaven. The whole earth is 
plunged in mourning; heaven rejoices. A 
strong angel casts into the sea a millstone, 
signifying the utter and overwhelming over- 
throw of Babylon, and the reason thereof is 
declared. 

In the next section we have a brief descrip- 
tion of the millennium. This is introduced 
by an account of heavenly rejoicing. There 
are three great movements of praise. The 



338 Revelation 



first is that of a great multitude in heaven. 
The second is that of the elders and the living 
ones. The third is that of a mighty chorus, 
which John describes by a threefold symbol, 
as the voice of a great multitude, of many 
waters, of mighty thunders. Immediately fol- 
lowing, the marriage ceremony of the Lamb 
is described, and Jesus is manifested to the 
world. It is the coming of the true King into 
His Kingdom. His name is "The Word of 
God,'' that by which He was known when He 
appeared full of grace and truth. Man in his 
rebellion is gathered to oppose Him. The bat- 
tle is immediately joined. There is no inde- 
cision, no varying fortunes. It is quick, 
sharp, decisive, terrible. The King and His 
armies are supernatural. It is the hour when 
heaven is touching earth. The spiritualities 
which men have refused to acknowledge are 
carrying out a judgment due to blasphemous 
denial. Victory having thus been obtained 
over all the manifestation of godlessness on 
earth, Satan is arrested and imprisoned. 

Then follows in brief sentences the only ac- 
count which this book contains of the actual 
millennium. It will be a time of perfect 
earthly government, an absolute monarchy, 
that of the God-appointed and anointed 
King. 



The Unveiling of Jesus Christ 339 

The final section deals with millennial is- 
sues. During the period of perfect govern- 
ment no active rebellion will be possible, but 
there will still exist an unmanifested capacity 
for rebellion. At the close of the period Satan 
will be loosed in order that once again hidden 
evil may be brought to light for final destruc- 
tion. Then follows the last apostasy, and fire 
devours its armies. 

John now saw that last assize when the 
dead, small and great, will be gathered before 
the Judge. Finally Death and Hades are cast 
into the lake of fire, and John beholds beyond 
it the beginning of the great Kingdom of the 
Son, that glorious reign of the Lamb in asso- 
ciation with His Bride, over an earth and a 
heaven from which all evil has been finally 
banished. Toward a city of God, men have 
looked through long generations, and now at 
last it comes out of heaven from God. A new 
order of laughter without tears, of life with- 
out death, of singing without mourning, of 
content without care, of pleasure without pain, 
will have dawned for the world. 

Epilogue 

The great unveiling is accomplished. What 
follows is of the nature of ratification and en- 
forcement. The final words of Jesus declare 



840 Revelation 



all to be faithful and true, announce His ad- 
vent, call all trusting souls to Himself, and 
utter solemn warnings. The final word of 
John is that of assent and invitation to his 
Lord, and the benediction pronounced upon 
all the saints.
